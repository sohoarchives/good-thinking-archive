Research shows that 700,000 Londoners say they feel lonely ‘most’ or ‘all' of the time and London has even been named the loneliest place to live in the UK.   And, contrary to popular belief that it’s mainly older people who experience loneliness, it affects many young adults – a recent study revealed that 16 to 29-year-olds are over two times as likely to report feeling lonely often or always than those over the age of 70.  Unfortunately, loneliness is associated with an increased risk of certain mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, stress, low self-esteem and sleep disorders.   With this in mind, Good Thinking is proud to support Great Mental Health Day 2024 (#GreatMentalHealth) on Friday 26 January, which is highlighting the power of relationships and social networks as a way to boost your wellbeing. We believe that, in challenging times, it’s more important than ever to reach out to others and stay connected.

Meanwhile, community centres, pubs and other traditional hubs for social connection are waning and the rising cost of living has made socialising more difficult than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>And although we’re supposed to be more connected than ever through the internet and social media apps, sadly it often provides what I describe as a ‘fast food diet of connection’.&nbsp;</p><p>But the turning point for me personally came during lockdown when I felt increasingly isolated and in a far lonelier place than I’d ever been before. I was working from home, couldn’t see my friends and my long-term relationship had come to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the two years, my social circle had slowly but surely been devastated by the pandemic and communities that I had been part of had been forced to dissolve.</p><p>So coming out of the pandemic in 2021, I was left with the need to rebuild and yet, when I looked at the available options for connection, I was bemused that the only options seemed to be faith groups, sports clubs and, worst of all, dating apps.</p><p>There was nothing for young adults who simply wanted to connect, build new friendships, find community and rebuild their social circle, whilst exploring the very best of what London has to offer.</p><p>So, The Great London Friendship Project was very much born out of my own frustration, my own desire for connection and a passion to help other Londoners who were in the same situation as me to cultivate meaningful connections.</p>",

With this year’s theme being ‘Let’s connect’, we’re proud that our new Good Thinking guides will help families across London to make meaningful connections and support other people’s mental wellbeing.</p><p>Over the last five years, we’ve worked with various youth organisations, including Partnership for Young London, The Student Room, Muslim Youth Helpline and The Diana Award, to co-create Good Thinking resources based on lived experience of mental ill health. For Children’s Mental Health Week 2023, we’ve once again teamed up with Partnership for Young London to get direct input from teens and also worked with Thrive LDN to incorporate its conversation starter tips in our new guides.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of what you’ll find in the guides, which are available <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-guides/quick-guides-support-others\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

I would recommend it to anyone suffering with poor mental health and may be hesitant to seek professional help. This app would give them the confidence to reach out and potentially calm negative thoughts as answered are provided.”</span><em style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"> </em><strong style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"><em>Page (</em>15 years old)</strong></blockquote><blockquote><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">“I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of categories available for helping you, such as ‘confidence boost’ or ‘sleep better’. There was even a playlist for ‘stop smoking’ and even though of course it may not be 100% effective, it could be used alongside smoking cessation advice from GPs or specialist services to stop smoking.” </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">Jakob (17 years old)</strong></blockquote><blockquote><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">﻿“The Feeling Good app is an extremely useful app that I’d recommend for anyone and everyone. Through exploring it, I found that it guides one in making peace with the all-consuming worries and struggles that exist in life, by immersing the user in its relaxing and calming world. It helped to put me at ease and it leaves you, as the title says, feeling good.” </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">Salem (18 years old)</strong></blockquote>",

							"content": "<p>With the launch of Good Thinking in November 2017, London became the first global city to deliver a city-wide digital mental wellbeing service. It was built on in-depth user insights and we had a clear mission: use digital technologies to provide free, personalised, safe, high-quality mental health support that Londoners could access 24/7. Our initial focus was on offering clinically-validated self-assessments and NHS-approved apps.</p><p><strong><em>“It’s a really good website and for people who are a bit reluctant to speak to people, it's very good to turn to, like the advice in there really did help me, especially with the sleep so it's something I am thankful for.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>Back in 2017, no one had any idea that two enormous mental health challenges lay ahead: a global pandemic and a cost of living crisis. To help Londoners who were anxious about COVID-19 and those who sadly lost loved ones to the virus, we quickly expanded Good Thinking’s resources to include hundreds of new ‘how to’ guides, podcasts, videos and workbooks. We also worked closely with faith and belief communities across London to provide tailored wellbeing content and support. And, now, we are offering advice on dealing with the stress of rising household bills and how to remain resilient this winter.</p><p><strong><em>“I love the part about faith and belief communities… it's amazing because I didn’t find anything like that on other websites, it is very inclusive, very sensitive.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>More than 690,000 people have used the Good Thinking service over the last five years – at home, at school, at university and at work; on the bus and on the tube; in the middle of the afternoon and in the early hours of the morning. We’re extremely proud to have had almost a million total visits to our website since 2017 but we’re determined to help even more Londoners find their own path to good mental wellbeing.</p><p><strong><em>“I'd definitely recommend it as a place with useful tips for people like those moving to university, going through bereavement, children.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>To mark our fifth anniversary, we’ve once again asked Good Thinking stakeholders, including users and representatives of the NHS and local government, for their feedback about the service. We’ve taken their comments and updated the look and feel of Good Thinking and made it easier to find the advice and tools you need to help you look after your mental wellbeing. We’ll unveil the refreshed Good Thinking service later this month – you can rest assured, it still has the same resources that hundreds of thousands of people already trust.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>To hear about how Good Thinking is supporting Londoners this winter, please join us at our virtual event at 11:00-12:00 on Thursday 17 November 2022. Professor Kevin Fenton, Regional Director for London at the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), will lead the discussion on the impact of the cost of living crisis on mental health and the importance of boosting community resilience through collaboration.

We’ve faced restrictions on things that we previously took for granted, such as spending time with family and friends, going on holiday and even taking part in activities that we used to enjoy when looking after our health and wellbeing, such as going to the gym, cinema or theatre. This sense of isolation and the worries and fears that some people have experienced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have put a strain on mental health and wellbeing for many of us.</p><p>Great Mental Health Day was conceived by the London borough of Haringey but now has support spanning the whole of London in collaboration with Thrive LDN and Good Thinking. The event aims to:</p><ul><li>raise awareness of the mental health services, community organisations and activities available both locally and regionally across London;</li><li>challenge stigma often associated with mental health and asking for help;</li><li>encourage frank and open conversations about mental health and wellbeing; and</li><li>sign-post Londoners to the most appropriate form of advice and help to meet their needs.</li></ul><p>Keep an eye out on our social media pages on Great Mental Health Day, where we’ll be posting information about the range of advice, guidance and support available through the Good Thinking service.</p><p>We’d also love you to get involved. Why not share a short video on social media telling us how you look after your mental health and wellbeing, destress, sleep better or reduce anxiety. Don’t forget to tag us in.</p><p><strong>Twitter</strong> - @GoodThinkingUK</p><p><strong>Facebook and Instagram</strong> - @goodthinkinguk</p><p>Use the hashtag <strong>#greatmentalhealth</strong></p><p>You can find out more about the London-wide Great Mental Health Day campaign <a href=\"https://thriveldn.co.uk/campaigns/greatmentalhealth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/subscribe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to our monthly e-newsletter</a>, offering resources, advice and guidance to help you look after your mental health and wellbeing.</p>",
