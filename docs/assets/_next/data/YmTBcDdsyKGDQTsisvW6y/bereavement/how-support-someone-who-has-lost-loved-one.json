You can play a vital role in helping them through this difficult time. If you’re not sure what you can do, Good Thinking has put together the following tips.</p>","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsInfoTabs","id":"38","tabs":[{"id":"191","title":"Tip 1: Reach out","content":"<p>Getting in touch with your relative or friend after they have lost someone can make them feel less isolated and help them on their grief journey. A phone call, text message, card or letter can be a great comfort. If you can meet up in person, that might be even better – a hug is often much needed</p><p>Don’t worry too much about saying the right thing – it’s more important that you say something rather than find the perfect words. Share your condolences and some thoughts about the person who died. For example, you might like to say something along the lines of “They were such a wonderful and kind person and will be hugely missed”.</p><p>Remind your relative or friend that you are there for them and give them the opportunity to talk about their memories of their loved one – for example, you could ask them about their favourite holiday together or the times they made them laugh. After a death, it’s common for the person grieving to want to go over what happened leading up to the death many times. Just being there to listen can be extremely helpful.</p>"},{"id":"192","title":"Tip 2: Offer practical support","content":"<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Providing practical support can really help when someone is grieving, especially if the person you are supporting has children or other caring responsibilities. Perhaps you could collect their children from school, walk their dog or cook some healthy meals for their family?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">They might also have new administrative tasks that they now have to manage on their own, such as arranging the funeral or other cultural rituals and looking after property or household bills. Talk to them about any worries they have about this and, if you can, signpost them to relevant support organisations – you can find a list of useful websites below.</span></p>"},{"id":"193","title":"Tip 3: Help them to remember","content":"<p>Celebrations of life, funeral services and other ceremonies provide an occasion to say goodbye and see other family members and friends. This can help those grieving to face the reality of what has happened and begin the journey towards reconciliation and closure. As time goes on, just listening to your relative or friend talking about their memories can also be a powerful way to help.</p>"},{"id":"194","title":"Tip 4: Direct them to support organisations","content":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"> While there is no set timetable for grief, it should ease over time so that people can move forward. In some cases, however, your relative or friend might still be struggling and might experience complicated grief. They might have trouble carrying out their normal routine, withdraw from social activities or experience depression or guilt, for example.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"> If this is the case, you might want to encourage them to get support from a specialist bereavement service (e.g. helpline, online forum, counselling, talking therapies).
