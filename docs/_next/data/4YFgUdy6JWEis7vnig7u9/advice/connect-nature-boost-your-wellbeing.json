And with London being one of the greenest cities in Europe (it was named a National Park City in 2019), the Good Thinking team would encourage you to explore the many natural spaces as a way to improve your mental health.</p><p>According to a 2021 survey by the<a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/news/seven-ten-uk-adults-say-being-close-nature-improves-their-mood-mental-health-awareness-week\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Mental Health Foundation</a>, seven in 10 UK adults say that being close to nature improves their mood. As the charity's Chief Executive Mark Rowland comments, “Nature can be a powerful ally in protecting our mental health. During the pandemic, millions of us discovered nature's power to relieve stress, worry, anxiety and restore us with positive emotions, such as joy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many other studies have found positive links between nature and mental wellbeing – being outside can reduce stress, improve mood, encourage physical activity and facilitate social interactions. For example, a<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325366142_Efficacy_of_nature-based_therapy_for_individuals_with_stress-related_illnesses_Randomised_controlled_trial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> trial</a> in Denmark found that a particular type of nature-based therapy was as effective as a specific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for treating stress-related illnesses and research by the University of Derby has led to the development of the<a href=\"https://findingnature.org.uk/2019/01/28/5-ways-to-wellbeing-with-nature/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> five ways to wellbeing with nature</a>. A study by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/bird-birdsong-encounters-improve-mental-health-study\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">King’s College London</a> has even revealed that seeing or hearing birds boosts mental wellbeing.</p><p>In recent years, awareness of climate change and other environmental issues has grown and so too has our appreciation of the natural world. Indeed, many called for a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to help fix our broken relationship with nature.</p><p>As Adam Murray, Head of Community Empowerment at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), says: “Connecting with the natural world is more important than ever. [During the pandemic], as we juggled work, family life and wellbeing, all from the confines of home, the natural world became a playground, a gym, a tonic, and much more besides. But while our lives have changed, the threats to nature have not gone away.”</p><p><br></p><h3>Good Thinking's tips for Londoners</h3>","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsInfoTabs","id":"71","tabs":[{"id":"393","title":"1.
