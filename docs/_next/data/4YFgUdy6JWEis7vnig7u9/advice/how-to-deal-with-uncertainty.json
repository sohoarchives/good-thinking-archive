We never really know what's going to happen from one day to the next, which can be both a positive (excitement and spontaneity) and a negative (fear and concern) for our mental health. With the current global political situation in particular, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, as well as challenges closer to home, such as the cost of living, you might be particularly worried about the unknowns right now. In fact, you might be feeling frightened, angry or experiencing other strong emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>Good Thinking is here to help Londoners improve their mental wellbeing. We know that uncertainty can lead to anxiety, stress and other mental health concerns so, in this article, we provide some techniques to help you adapt to what might happen next.</p><h3>1. Remember that there are always uncertainties</h3><p>Think back to previous experiences and how you dealt with them. Did you predict that something bad would happen just because you were uncertain? What did you do to get through the situation? Did worrying about the worst-case scenario change the outcome? Recognising the need for certainty and predictability means you can do something about it. You can then pause and try to let go of it. </p><p>The <strong>APPLE</strong> technique is a useful thought process to follow when you feel anxious or worried:</p><ul><li><strong>Acknowledge</strong> - notice and acknowledge the uncertainty when it comes to mind.</li><li><strong>Pause</strong> - don't react to the uncertainty. Just take a moment to pause and breathe.</li><li><strong>Pull back</strong> - tell yourself that this is just the worry talking. This apparent need for certainty is not helpful or necessary. It's only a thought or feeling, and not a fact.</li><li><strong>Let go</strong> - let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don't need to respond to it. Perhaps imagine it floating away in a bubble or cloud.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong> - At this present moment, everything is OK. Notice your breathing, focus on what you can see, hear and touch right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else, like what you were doing before you started to worry. </li></ul><h3><strong>2. Focus on what's in your control</strong></h3><p>We all have much more control over what we do than how we feel. While you can’t control things like how the UK Government responds to a particular issue, you can take action yourself. For example, if you’re worried about paying your household bills this winter, contact your energy provider or a charity, such as <a href=\"https://debtfree.london\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Free London</a>. Or if you want to support or donate supplies to people in need, take a look at the work that charities are doing both in the UK and across the globe. Completing these kinds of activities will help to give you a sense of achievement and some peace of mind.</p><h3><strong>3. Be present in the moment</strong></h3><p>If your mind keeps wandering back to the uncertainty of the coming weeks and months and you’re experiencing a spiral of ‘What if...?’ questions, you could try some breathing, mindfulness or meditation techniques.
