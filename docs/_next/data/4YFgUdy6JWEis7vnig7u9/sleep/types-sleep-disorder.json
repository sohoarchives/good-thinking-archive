They can occur in sleep or in the transition between being asleep and awake.</p><p>Different types of parasomnia include:</p><ul><li>Night terrors (also called sleep terrors):&nbsp;You abruptly arouse from sleep with a cry or scream.

It happens when the walls of the throat relax. This interrupts normal breathing.&nbsp;</p><p>Having obstructive sleep apnoea may affect the quality of your sleep. This is because pauses in breathing cause you to sleep less heavily, so your airway reopens.</p><p>You may not notice you have the condition. A partner may alert you that you may have it by telling you that your breathing is laboured in the night. If you think you may have obstructive sleep apnoea, speak to your doctor for advice.</p><h3><strong>Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)</strong></h3><p>Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) is a sleep disorder where you repeatedly move your limbs in your sleep.

Your internal body clock may not work as it should.</p><p>If you have this condition you may regularly find it hard to wake up in time for work. This can disrupt your daily routine.</p><p>Shift work sleep disorder is a specific type of circadian rhythm disorder caused by shift patterns that overlap a person’s normal sleep period.&nbsp;</p><p>If you think you may have a circadian rhythm disorder, speak to your doctor.
