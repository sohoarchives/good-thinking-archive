They also believe that the soul’s next incarnation depends on the person’s&nbsp;<em>karma </em>(actions during their previous life). Ultimately, Hindus believe that through praxis, accumulation of good karma, and divine grace,&nbsp;<em>moksha</em>&nbsp;(liberation) can be achieved after death. Liberation is characterised as the attainment of the transcendent.</p>"},{"id":"256","title":"What rituals take place before someone dies?","content":"<p>In all branches of Hinduism, family plays a key role in helping their loved one prepare for their death and rebirth. Certain rituals occur in the final moments, including:</p><ul><li>Relatives may wish to sit at the patient’s bedside, sing&nbsp;<em>bhajans</em>&nbsp;(devotional songs), read sacred texts (e.g. from the&nbsp;<em>Veda</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Bhagavad Gita)</em>&nbsp;and chant mantras. They may also ask for a Hindu priest to be present.</li><li>There may be a request to turn the patient’s bed so their head faces east or for the patient to be allowed to lie on the floor in the moments before death (so that they are close to mother earth and their soul can depart easily).</li></ul>"},{"id":"257","title":"What should health and care professionals bear in mind?","content":"<p>Caring for someone who is dying involves looking after their physical, emotional and spiritual needs.</p><p>It is important to identify a person’s religious inclinations at the start of their care and to find out what they need when approaching the end of life. If they are in hospital, it is helpful to inform the chaplain about their spiritual needs (with the patient’s permission).</p><p>Whilst it may be difficult to observe all Hindu death rituals in a hospital or care home, it is helpful to remember the following so that the patient can stay true to their faith:</p><ul><li>Family is very important in Hinduism and healthcare decisions should be made together (normally with the most senior family member or eldest child).</li><li>After someone dies, their body should be treated with respect. The family should be consulted about any jewellery and religious symbols that need to be left in place.</li><li>The body of the deceased should be released as quickly as possible to enable the family to prepare for the funeral. Organ donation is accepted and encouraged in the Hindu faith and should be discussed with the family when appropriate.</li></ul>"},{"id":"258","title":"What rituals take place after someone dies?","content":"<p>Specific rituals depend on the patient’s affiliation to a particular Hindu tradition. However, often, a Hindu priest is asked to perform the&nbsp;<em>antyeshti</em>&nbsp;(funeral rites). The funeral directors will take the body for bathing, dressing and anointing with the permission and in the presence of chosen friends and relatives before the funeral rites take place.</p><p>Hindus generally prefer cremation over burial and the funeral usually takes place as soon as possible after death. Whilst it is favourable to do this within 24 hours, it is widely accepted amongst the Hindu community that the administrative process will take longer in the UK. Mourners customarily choose to wear simple, white clothing to the funeral, although this is not a religious requirement, and a Hindu priest usually leads the prayers.</p><p>Through cremation, the five basic elements, known as the&nbsp;<em>panchbhut</em>, are returned to the universe, signifying the maintenance of cosmic equilibrium. The ashes are usually scattered in a local river or the sea or maybe taken to India to be scattered in any one of the holy rivers, such as the Ganga.</p><p>The Hindu mourning period (<em>sutak</em>) typically lasts ten to thirteen days and includes various rituals, such as prayers and preparing certain foods, depending on the particular Hindu tradition of the family. Some Hindu traditions advocate devotional singing and scriptural recital during this time, rather than consider it a time of mourning; instead, realising it as a celebration that the soul has now been liberated and resides eternally in the abode of God. On the first anniversary of the death, a memorial event (<em>shraaddha</em>) is held to pay homage to the deceased.</p>"},{"id":"259","title":"How can people of the Hindu faith be supported when grieving?","content":"<p>Although Hindus take solace in their belief in reincarnation and liberation, they still experience grief. This may include feelings of shock, sadness, and even guilt.</p><p>Certain Hindus may choose to remain at home during the mourning period and not visit the temple. However, this is not a religious requirement and entering the temple during the mourning period is not forbidden. Friends and relatives may visit to offer condolences and participate in Hindu prayer and scriptural readings to provide solace to the bereaved.</p><p>If the bereaved person would rather speak to someone they don’t know or needs additional support, specialist bereavement support services (see below) are available.</p>"},{"id":"260","title":"Resources for the Hindu community","content":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.baatn.org.uk/bamestream-bereavement-support-service/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BAMEStream Bereavement Support Service</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.hinducounciluk.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hindu Council UK</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.hfb.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hindu Forum of Britain</a></li></ul>"},{"id":"263","title":"Bereavement support for all faiths","content":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ataloss.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AtaLoss (directory of services)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cruse.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cruse</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.thegoodgrieftrust.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Good Grief Trust</a></li><li><a href=\"https://thriveldn.co.uk/about/our-activities/london-bereavement-support-programme/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive LDN: London Bereavement Support Programme</a></li></ul>"},{"id":"261","title":"Bereavement resources for health and care professionals","content":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/JC_0323_Good_Thinking_Bereavement_v3_cd24b34921.pdf?updated_at=2022-11-01T16:41:13.337Z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Thinking (How to provide culturally sensitive bereavement support: A guide for practitioners)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bereavement-Practices-Jan-2021.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS (Understanding different bereavement practices and how our colleagues may experience grief)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sudden.org/tools/cultural-and-religious-issues-professionals-may-encounter-following-a-bereavement/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sudden (Cultural and religious issues professionals may encounter following a bereavement)</a></li></ul>"},{"id":"262","title":"Good Thinking bereavement resources for all faiths","content":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/cope-bereavement-and-grief\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to cope with bereavement and grief (advice for adults)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-cope-death-loved-one/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to cope with the death of a loved one (advice for young people)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-support-someone-who-has-lost-loved-one/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to support someone who has lost a loved one (advice for relatives and friends)</a></li></ul>"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
