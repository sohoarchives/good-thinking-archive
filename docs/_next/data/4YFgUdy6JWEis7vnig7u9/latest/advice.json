That might really help with feelings of loneliness.”</em></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 46, 47);\">With loneliness sometimes leading to low mood, anxiety, stress, sleep problems and other mental health concerns, it’s important that you take action and get the right support. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 46, 47);\">In this article, we look at some initiatives that are helping Londoners to tackle loneliness and isolation at all ages and stages of life. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 46, 47);\">Our guide to the </span><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/advice/five-ways-good-mental-wellbeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(43, 46, 47);\">five ways to good mental wellbeing</a><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 46, 47);\"> might also be useful if you’re feeling lonely.

While you’re sleeping, your body is busy repairing cells, resetting hormones and allowing muscles to rest that have all been used throughout the day. Regular poor sleep can disrupt this regeneration process, potentially placing you at increased risk of a range of health conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, infection and diabetes. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">On a mental level, sleep gives you time to process the information you took in during the day and lay down memories. Unhealthy sleep behaviours and tiredness can impact your mental health, for example, by developing or worsening anxiety, depression and loneliness. It can also be a bit of a vicious cycle, with mental health conditions, such as stress, in turn affecting your sleep.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">In the </span><a href=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/GT_Sleep_Workbook_final_version_f7822b74db.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">sleep workbook</a><span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> that she developed for Good Thinking, Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist Majella Cogan notes that most people will have trouble sleeping at some point in their lives.

So, we also asked the DHAs about how they start conversations with their friends.</p><p>One young person suggested “A simple ‘how are you?’, checking up, maybe in a text message if you don’t want to say it face to face” is a good starting point. Another noted the importance of giving friends a safe space to talk. As they said, “Even just letting them know, I’m here any time you need me. If and when you’re ready to open up, feel free to come to me.”</p><p>Of course, parents, carers, teachers, health and care professionals and other adults play a vital role in helping children and young people to understand themselves better and become more resilient.</p><p>Here at Good Thinking, we provide a wide range of resources to help adults support children and young people (see links below).

In fact, sleep problems are one of the most common psychological reasons for GP appointments and, left untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or worsening of anxiety, depression, hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>At the moment, the rising cost of living is affecting many people’s sleep and mental health.

We fear this will only get worse over the next few months and is on top of the growing mental health need which arose from the pandemic.”</p><p>If you’re worrying about your finances and other practical issues, prioritising sleep can help you to tackle them more effectively. In fact, research shows that being helped to sleep better helps to reduce stress so, in this article, Good Thinking provides some tips for getting a better night’s sleep.</p><p>If you’d like more comprehensive advice, check out the Good Thinking <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/sleep-workbook/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Workbook</a>, which we developed with sleep expert Majella Cogan and which is based on a well-established and effective therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia.&nbsp;</p><h3>Three reasons to put sleep first</h3><p>1. <strong>Self-control: </strong>When we’re sleep deprived, the brain enters survival mode – we dial up activity in the emotional fear centres, making us feel more anxious and sensitive to threats. At the same time, we downgrade activity in the parts of the brain responsible for less urgent activities like planning and self-control. This is why it’s much harder to stick to our goals when we’re not getting enough sleep.</p><p>2. <strong>Appetite: </strong>When we cut sleep short, we throw our internal body clocks into disarray. We produce more of a hormone called grehlin, which makes us hungry, and less leptin, which makes us feel full. So, we get more of the munchies after a bad night’s sleep and we’re less likely to resist our cravings.</p><p>3. <strong>Memory:</strong> We consolidate new memories while we’re sleeping at night, putting the most important into long-term storage and discarding the unnecessary ones.</p><h3>Three things that can help you sleep better</h3><p>1. <strong>Start a sleep diary:</strong> For seven days, write down when you go to sleep, what time you wake up and how energised you feel during the day. Most adults need at least seven hours sleep to function at their best but your sleep need is unique to you.</p><p>2. <strong>Prepare for sleep:</strong> An hour before bed, start to unwind and detach from the day. Leave tech out of the bedroom – it interferes with melatonin, your body’s signal for sleep. A daily ritual of relaxation, such as reading a book or listening to soothing music, will help with readiness for sleep.</p><p>3. <strong>Learn the tricks of the trade: </strong>To transform your sleep habits for the better and ease a racing mind, take some time to learn more about sleep and why it’s so important.

As Robin Hewings, Programme Director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, who co-authored the GLA report, says, “Severe loneliness has a massive impact on people’s lives and their health and mental wellbeing. It overlaps with depression and anxiety and feelings of despair and alienation.”&nbsp;</p><p>There are lots of reasons why people experience loneliness. For example, if you’re a student who has moved away from home, a new parent with little time, a member of the LGBTQ+ community who faces discrimination or an older person who lives alone, you might feel lonely at times. The cost of socialising is also becoming a factor as people tighten their belts during the cost of living crisis. In a recent <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/11/05/socialising-now-seen-as-a-luxury-due-to-the-cost-of-living-crisis-17696901/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metro</a> article, Tracey Robbins, UK Delivery Manager, Eden Project Communities, commented, “I just really worry that people see connecting with others as a luxury… people begin to feel lonely without real human connection and that’s when you can see people cut themselves off from the ‘real world’.”&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-government-research-identifies-clear-links-between-loneliness-and-mental-health-distress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> by the UK Government identifying direct links between chronic loneliness and mental health distress, there is a renewed effort to tackle loneliness in the UK.

We never really know what's going to happen from one day to the next, which can be both a positive (excitement and spontaneity) and a negative (fear and concern) for our mental health. With the current global political situation in particular, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, as well as challenges closer to home, such as the cost of living, you might be particularly worried about the unknowns right now. In fact, you might be feeling frightened, angry or experiencing other strong emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>Good Thinking is here to help Londoners improve their mental wellbeing. We know that uncertainty can lead to anxiety, stress and other mental health concerns so, in this article, we provide some techniques to help you adapt to what might happen next.</p><h3>1. Remember that there are always uncertainties</h3><p>Think back to previous experiences and how you dealt with them. Did you predict that something bad would happen just because you were uncertain? What did you do to get through the situation? Did worrying about the worst-case scenario change the outcome? Recognising the need for certainty and predictability means you can do something about it. You can then pause and try to let go of it. </p><p>The <strong>APPLE</strong> technique is a useful thought process to follow when you feel anxious or worried:</p><ul><li><strong>Acknowledge</strong> - notice and acknowledge the uncertainty when it comes to mind.</li><li><strong>Pause</strong> - don't react to the uncertainty. Just take a moment to pause and breathe.</li><li><strong>Pull back</strong> - tell yourself that this is just the worry talking. This apparent need for certainty is not helpful or necessary. It's only a thought or feeling, and not a fact.</li><li><strong>Let go</strong> - let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don't need to respond to it. Perhaps imagine it floating away in a bubble or cloud.</li><li><strong>Explore</strong> - At this present moment, everything is OK. Notice your breathing, focus on what you can see, hear and touch right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else, like what you were doing before you started to worry. </li></ul><h3><strong>2. Focus on what's in your control</strong></h3><p>We all have much more control over what we do than how we feel. While you can’t control things like how the UK Government responds to a particular issue, you can take action yourself. For example, if you’re worried about paying your household bills this winter, contact your energy provider or a charity, such as <a href=\"https://debtfree.london\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Free London</a>. Or if you want to support or donate supplies to people in need, take a look at the work that charities are doing both in the UK and across the globe. Completing these kinds of activities will help to give you a sense of achievement and some peace of mind.</p><h3><strong>3. Be present in the moment</strong></h3><p>If your mind keeps wandering back to the uncertainty of the coming weeks and months and you’re experiencing a spiral of ‘What if...?’ questions, you could try some breathing, mindfulness or meditation techniques. Check out the free <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/be-mindful/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Be Mindful</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/meditainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meditainment</a> apps available through Good Thinking, as well as our <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/podcasts-videos-webinars/why-micropause-can-help-your-mental-health-today\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">podcast about mindfulness</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>In times of uncertainty, it’s more important than ever to do everything you can to stay mentally healthy.

With this article, the Good Thinking team aims to help people across London to manage these feelings and improve their mental wellbeing.</p><p>Whilst stress is a perfectly normal, even healthy, reaction in the body and mind to some type of threat (it prepares you for ‘fight or flight’), when you face ongoing threats and challenges, it becomes something quite different. When you’re stressed, you might experience a range of <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/symptoms-stress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">symptoms</a>, including back pain, stomach upsets and feeling tired or irritable.</p><p>Of course, there are different <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/types-stress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">types of stress</a>. When you prepare for an important exam or meeting or when you’re stuck in traffic, the stress is short term and reaches an end point. Compare that with the ongoing emotional pressure you feel if you have a busy job, an unhappy family situation or money worries, which may lead to chronic or long-term stress.</p><p>When someone is highly stressed we sometimes say that they have 'lost their mind' and, in some ways, they may have, if their mind has been invaded by worries about things they can’t possibly control. Keeping all of your concerns about the economy and other issues under control can be exhausting and, at some point, you might start to drown in them. But that will get you nowhere. Fortunately, there are things you can do to reduce these kinds of stresses.</p><h3>Focus on what you can do</h3><p>Dr Russ Harris, author of <a href=\"https://thehappinesstrap.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Happiness Trap</a>, suggests there is something simple that you can do to reduce stress: “...the single most useful thing anyone can do in any type of crisis… is to focus on what’s in your control.”</p><p>When we focus on something that we can do, which has some sort of end, we feel more effective and less trapped – even if it doesn’t always go right. So, if you’re stuck in a situation that is stressful, whether at home or at work, make sure you focus on the small things you can do that make a difference. That might be doing some chores, appreciating the food you cook, listening to your favourite podcast or doing something nice for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>The really important thing is to not measure the size of what you do; it is completing the activity that will give you some feeling of achievement. When you focus on that, it is really powerful. A study of those fleeing war zones and persecution found that this activity of focusing on some part of their life where they had control gave them hope and helped them to cope better with stress, even though they may have lost their homes and members of their family.</p><h3>Don’t drown in worries</h3><p>On Good Thinking, free NHS-approved wellbeing apps like <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/be-mindful/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Be Mindful</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/my-possible-self/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">My Possible Self</a> can help guide you in the process of lowering stress. If you feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to focus, you might find the <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/meditainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meditainment</a> programme helpful. The programme is a unique blend of guided meditation and visualisation, enhanced with relaxing music and authentic sounds of nature that leads you on a fantastical multi-meditation journey, discovering imaginative audio-guided adventures that promote better mental health and wellbeing in an enjoyable and exciting way.</p><p>Occasional moderate stress tends not to cause mental health problems but if you often feel stressed and it’s affecting the way you behave towards others, speak to your GP who might be able to refer you to a specialist counselling service. You could also use the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/mental-health/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS Talking Therapies service finder</a> to get details of your nearest NHS Talking Therapy service or, if you need urgent support, please contact your <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/urgent-support/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local 24/7 NHS mental health helpline</a>.</p><p>The better you can focus on what you can control, the more clearly you can take in that not everything is out of control. If there are tough things to face or sort out, you’ll be in better shape to take on those challenges. And, once you’re feeling less stressed, you’ll be in a stronger position to support your family, friends and wider community.</p><p>As Dr Harris says, you can’t control certain situations and you can’t even control how you feel about them. So, step away from the bigger picture for a moment and make a note of something you can do, a behaviour that you can be in control of. It might just throw you a line and rescue you from drowning in worries.</p><h2>Good Thinking resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/cci-mindfulness-workbook/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Clinical Interventions Mindfulness Workbook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/free-apps-for/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Free NHS-approved wellbeing apps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/connect-nature-boost-your-wellbeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to connect with nature to improve your wellbeing (article)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/JC_0423_GT_Mental_Health_and_Me_v4_1_6edfce37dd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">‘Mental health and me’ guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/podcasts-videos-webinars/why-micropause-can-help-your-mental-health-today\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Why a micropause can help your mental health today (podcast)</a></li></ul><h2>Useful websites</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health Foundation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/stress/what-is-stress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/stress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Samaritans</a></li><li><a href=\"https://giveusashout.org/get-help/resources/stress-and-anxiety-support/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shout</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.themix.org.uk/mental-health/stress-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Mix</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youngminds.org.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YoungMinds</a></li></ul>","columnWidth":"full"}]},{"__typename":"Advice","title":"How to look after your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","slug":"how-to-look-after-your-mental-health-during-covid-19-pandemic","subtitle":"Good Thinking has lots of apps and other resources to support you if you feel anxious, sleep deprived, stressed or sad, including a self-assessment tool that has been updated in line with Public Health England’s guidance on coronavirus.","updatedAt":"2025-03-20T16:17:47.735Z","publishedAt":"2022-11-01T20:29:34.491Z","metadata":{"id":"716","description":"How to look after your mental health during coronavirus.

Your emotions often come in waves and may include sadness, shock, guilt and anger. If you have children, they might have questions that are not easy to answer. And if you are already dealing with anxiety, low mood or another mental health concern, you might find it particularly hard to cope.</p><p>During the national period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, for example, you might have experienced difficult emotions – from feeling upset about her death and disorientated about the future to remembering your own loved ones who have died and even contemplating your own mortality. As Jane Murray, Bereavement Support Service Coordinator at Marie Curie, notes, “Times of collective grief may naturally trigger emotions and memories around unresolved grief from losses in your own life”.</p><p>If you or someone you know needs support following the death of a public figure, we hope you find Good Thinking’s bereavement and wellbeing resources helpful. The most important thing to remember is that it’s OK to feel however you’re feeling – everyone reacts differently to loss and we should always respect this and show kindness to one another.</p><p>If

The COVID-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis have made many of us stop and deliberately consider our lives. So, could this be the time to start doing something you feel would be good for your mental health?</p><p>In this article, we provide some tips to help you develop a new healthy habit (e.g.&nbsp;exercising, spending more time with family and getting enough sleep) which, in turn, could help to reduce anxiety, stress and low mood. These are based on the science of habit formation and the personal experience of the author, Paulina, an expert in behaviour change who works with the Good Thinking team.</p><p>But, first, what exactly is a habit? It’s not that easy to define. Think about one of your routine activities, such as doing the laundry or making a cup of tea – can you remember exactly when it became a habit?

I was inspired by my friend who wakes up at 6.30am and meditates for 90 minutes.

Even better if you pair it with something you already do on a daily basis. This uses a simple yet powerful technique called ‘implementation intention’.</p><p>In my case, I decided to pair my behaviour with something I do every morning (brushing my teeth) and use a meditation app (the <em>how</em>) to time myself. I made sure that my implementation intention (my action plan) was as specific as possible so I have little room for hesitation:</p><p><em>Each morning after I have brushed my teeth, I will sit on my sofa and meditate for 15 minutes using my meditation app.</em></p>"},{"id":"386","title":"Step 3: Repeat, repeat, repeat","content":"<p>…until it comes effortless and you no longer have to think about it.

rumours at school? Are you receiving nasty comments on your social channels? Have you been teased or harassed in the street? Unfortunately, bullying is all too common.

You might be bullied because of your race or sexual identity. The bullying might be verbal or physical. It might happen online (cyberbullying) or in person. There might be one individual bullying you or a group of people. Whatever your situation, it’s important that you know what action you can take and how to look after yourself.</p><p>We know it can sometimes be difficult to tell when a joke or banter tips over into something more serious so you might find this definition of bullying helpful: “Bullying is the repetitive, intentional hurting of one person or group by another person or group, where the relationship involves an imbalance of power. It can happen face to face or online.” In other words, bullying is when a person (or a group of people) does something mean or hurtful to someone else (or to another group) again and again and on purpose.</p><p>Good Thinking is here to help young Londoners who may be feeling sad, scared or stressed out because of bullying and who would like support for their mental health. As Martha Evans, Director of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, says, “Children and young people need to know there is help out there if they are being bullied. It starts by reaching out to someone you trust if you need to talk.”</p><p>To mark #AntiBullyingWeek 2024 (11-15 November), we’ve updated Good Thinking’s tips on bullying.

Tell someone you trust","content":"<p>If you’re being bullied, could you talk to an adult you trust (perhaps one of your parents or carers or a teacher)? Or have a chat with your brother, sister or a friend? There are lots of people who can support you and you’ll hopefully feel much better once you’ve told them.

Keep a record of what’s happening","content":"<p>Write down what happened, when it happened, who bullied you, who saw it happen and how it made you feel. If you’re being bullied online, take screen shots of any messages, emails or social media posts and save any photos or videos – then block the bully in your app settings. Records of any bullying incidents will be really useful if you decide to report the bully to your school, a social media provider or the police.</p>"},{"id":"404","title":" 3. Don’t retaliate","content":"<p>When someone’s being nasty to you, it can be really tempting to behave the same way. On social media, you might even find that other people are pressuring you to behave in ways you wouldn’t normally. The best thing to do is to take a step back – don’t respond or retaliate. Stay calm and tell someone you trust so that they can support you. If you see someone else being bullied, it’s OK to stick up for them but try not to get drawn into any bullying behaviour yourself.</p>"},{"id":"403","title":" 4. Surround yourself with people who make you feel good","content":"<p>Friends should always have your back so, if someone is bullying you, it’s time to move on. Focus on the people who make you laugh and who make you feel safe. If you’re being bullied online, could you take some time away from your phone and other devices? Try to meet up with your friends in real life and do something fun together – doing that is much better for your mental health.</p>"},{"id":"405","title":"5. Don’t blame yourself – it’s NOT your fault","content":"<p>There are many reasons why someone bullies another person. They might have things going on at home that make them feel stressed or sad or they might have been bullied themselves, for example. You might even find that a friend or partner becomes a bully. It’s not personal – they might not even realise they are hurting you. Just remember, it is never your fault that you’re being bullied.</p>"},{"id":"408","title":"6.

Don’t bottle things up.</p><p>If you’d rather speak to someone you don’t know, The Mix runs a <a href=\"https://www.themix.org.uk/get-support/speak-to-our-team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free helpline for under-25s</a> on 0808 808 4994 or you can chat to their team online. You could also find out if there are any support schemes for young carers in your borough (check your council’s website).</p><h3><strong>2. Make a plan</strong></h3><p>As a young carer, you should have an emergency plan in place in case you get ill and can’t look after your relative for a while. In this situation, replacement care can be sorted out for you. Having this kind of plan in place should give you some peace of mind.</p><p>Your plan should include contact details for other family members and friends, information about your relative’s GP and pharmacy, details of any medication they take, information about any care and support services they receive and details of any mobility or behavioural challenges. Give some trusted relatives and friends a copy of this plan.</p><p>Carers UK provides lots more <a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/search/planning-for-emergencies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">useful advice about writing an emergency plan</a>.</p><h3><strong>3. Ask for help</strong></h3><p>Your local authority can provide support – if you have a social worker or you’re in touch with your local young carers service, contact them. You could also talk to one of your teachers or a school counsellor or call <a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carers UK</a> on 0808 808 7777 for advice.</p><p>Good Thinking can recommend free NHS-approved wellbeing apps to reduce anxiety, lower stress, improve sleep and boost mood. If you think you would find this useful, visit our <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/free-apps-young-people/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">apps</a> page.</p><p>Contact your GP if you’re worried about your own health or the health of the person you’re looking after. Call NHS 111 for urgent medical help or 999 for life-threatening emergencies.</p><h3><strong>4. Look after yourself</strong></h3><p>When you’re caring for someone else, it’s easy to forget about looking after yourself. Try to eat healthily, stay hydrated and exercise regularly. You’ll find lots of inspiration on the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS Live Well website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sport England website</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/how-to-maintain-healthy-balanced-diet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Thinking’s advice about how to maintain a healthy, balanced diet</a>.</p><p>Make sure you get enough sleep too.
