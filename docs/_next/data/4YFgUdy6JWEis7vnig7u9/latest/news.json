She signed up too and we started training for it together. This included runs through the park near to where we live and it was here we saw a group of people wearing red T-shirts!&nbsp;</p><p>We’d seen GoodGym before through a Web search for running clubs but didn’t realise there was a group so close to us. Both keen to join, wanting to make new friends together, be active, and do good for the community, we signed up the next day! Our first task was litter picking.</p>"

Also, because mental health struggles often aren’t visible, people might appear “fine” on the outside while feeling entirely unwell inside, making it harder to receive any empathy or support.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when surrounded by others, like at races, people can feel deeply alone. I struggle massively with feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is largely imagined. Indeed, conditions like depression or anxiety can distort thinking, making people feel hopeless, worthless, or stuck in cycles.&nbsp;</p><p>It can become hard to separate incorrect thoughts from reality and things can become overwhelming. Even getting out of bed or answering an email can feel like an enormous task. I find myself overthinking often, and going down unhelpful rabbit holes and often self sabotaging relationships! This is especially true where I feel like I’m burdening others, which is why people tend to avoid reaching out for help. A lot of people don’t find help for this reason or a belief that their own struggles don’t matter or are a lot less compared to others.</p>"

I don’t have to pretend to be perfect. Community work thrives on vulnerability and shared experience. The more I connect with others, the more I realise I’m not alone. My struggles aren’t unique - but neither is my strength.</p><p>It’s also helped me build routine, purpose, and belonging - three things that make a real difference when you’re trying to manage your own wellbeing.

Running can make a huge difference too! I also write things down, especially when my thoughts feel tangled; getting them out of my head and onto paper helps me make sense of them.</p><p>I’ve become better at recognising when I need rest and when I need connection. Some days I need quiet, and other days I need to talk to someone who understands, although I do tend to overshare! I also try to protect my time and energy by setting boundaries, even though that’s still a work in progress.</p><p>Most importantly, I remind myself that it's okay to ask for help. Taking care of my mental health means staying honest with myself, being kind to myself, and treating my needs as valid.</p>"

We have more than 12,000 members of staff working across around 70 locations in north London, and we are committed to supporting their mental health in any way we can. It doesn’t just benefit them; it means they can continue to provide the very best care for our patients.&nbsp;</p><p>If anyone feels stressed or unhappy, it’s important to talk to someone so they don’t feel alone – and the trust offers a variety of talking therapies which staff can access whenever they need. This includes Care First, which provides a 24/7/365 support line and counselling service. The trust’s occupational health service has qualified clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians available to support staff’s emotional and psychological needs. For peer level support, the trust has trained mental health first aiders who assist by listening to staff and signposting them to appropriate services. Monthly managing stress sessions are provided virtually and chaplains of a variety of faiths are also available for spiritual care and support. In addition, one of our physiotherapists runs a staff walking group at the Royal Free Hospital; exercise is a crucial way in which can improve both our physical and mental health. Finally, our flexible working policy helps staff achieve a healthy work-life balance.</p><p>London is a wonderful place to live and it’s a city on the go. From the minute you wake up, you’re on a treadmill. Will the bus or train be on time? Will childcare run smoothly today? It’s important to build a network of supportive peers both at work and outside of work to help you cope with these pressures. Using one’s annual leave regularly to rest and recuperate is vital in achieving good mental health. Stepping away to relax, sleep and exercise helps to reduce stress levels and avoid burning out.</p><p>One of the most important things we do at the trust is to ask our employees what kind of mental health support they need through the national NHS survey. We work with our staff networks and wellbeing champions forum to keep evaluating what works and what doesn’t. For example, our employees wanted staff health and wellbeing days to be held at least three or four times a year. We work with various stakeholders to organise these – and a crucial part of the event are the massages provided to staff, which are funded by the Royal Free Charity. The trust also has an arts therapist who can help staff relieve stress through creativity. Our annual staff awards are aimed boosting staff morale and emphasising how much the trust appreciates and values everyone’s contributions to patient care.</p><p>Self-care is key. We all need to know ourselves, spot signs of poor mental health, understand our stress triggers and seek help. To continuously lower our stress levels, we need to seek out what we enjoy doing to avoid burn out. I like to get out into nature and take long walks whenever I have the opportunity; this helps to lower my stress levels and avoid burn out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust</a></p>"

If an organisation takes a proactive approach to mental health in the workplace and communicates well, it can make a world of difference.&nbsp;</p><p>For neurodivergent employees, for example, this might mean providing flexible hours and supporting them with routines at work. Employers in London also need to consider how living and working in the capital brings certain pressures – housing is expensive, commutes can be complex and time-consuming, and even though there are millions of people, you can still feel lonely.</p><p>Wellbeing initiatives that I’ve seen working well include flexible schedules, coaching and mentoring for employees (especially young workers and neurodivergent colleagues) and a safe space where staff can speak to someone without fear of judgement. Training in task management and time management can also be helpful for reducing workplace stress.</p><p>Through my own work as a specialist mentor at UMO for people with autism and ADHD, I’ve learned that there’s no substitute for talking things through. Of course, managers and supervisors need to have the right training and resources in place to support their teams.</p><p>The most important thing is to normalise conversations about mental health in the workplace.

We want people to stay fit and well and to live happy and fulfilling lives. We also know that mental health conditions are a major reason for sickness and absence from work.</p><p>As an employer in London, you have to be conscious of the challenges your employees face and support them in their wellbeing. For example, hybrid working works for some colleagues, but for others they might experience social isolation if they work from home most of the time. Getting out and about – into work or the community – is generally a good thing.</p><p>At the Health Innovation Network (HIN) South London, we have fantastic volunteer staff wellbeing representatives who spend time working on wellbeing initiatives for colleagues, such as wellbeing walks and other activities. I also work with a Trust in South East London that has a great programme of support for their employees, including additional support for international employees dealing with cultural challenges.</p><p>It can be difficult for employers (especially smaller organisations) to support employees who have different mental wellbeing needs or who might be looking for support for a family member or friend. I’d recommend seeing what’s available online at Good Thinking – there are lots of wellbeing resources, including digital apps and tools like My Possible Self, that you can use.</p><p>Fresh air and sunshine are my favourite ways to boost my own wellbeing.

It affects everyone within an organisation but there might be particular employees that need more support – for example, people from marginalised groups who face stigma and discrimination and people who work in high-pressured or difficult roles.</p><p>People in London can live quite isolated lives so you have to get the balance right with hybrid working. For me, it’s important to come into the office as it’s such a positive environment. Londoners might also struggle with the cost of living and balancing work with caring responsibilities at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at the National AIDS Trust, we do core hours at work – having this flexibility gives us more autonomy. I used to work at a mental health charity, which had Wellbeing Wednesday once a month, where you could take the afternoon off to do something good for your wellbeing.</p><p>Employers shouldn’t assume that line managers know how to deal with mental health conditions. They need training and support. And it’s important that high achievers aren’t ignored – they might be struggling even if they don’t seem to be.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s growing awareness of the importance of wellbeing in the workplace.

With people spending so much time at work, it’s essential that employers encourage open conversations about health and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>My advice to wellbeing leads would be to start small and build up. Make sure you have the right policies and processes in place, train your line managers so they have the skills to support their teams and provide a safe space where people can talk. You should also take advantage of the many free resources available to support people with lowering stress, improving sleep and dealing with other issues.</p><p>Here at Transformation Partners in Health and Care, we have a Wellbeing Matters network that promotes good wellbeing and organises events for colleagues. These include an annual Wellbeing Day, ‘tea and chat' for World Sleep Day, a staff picnic for Inclusion Week and regular wellbeing walks. They are really popular and it’s great to see so many colleagues getting involved. We also include regular tips and wellbeing advice in our employee newsletter.</p><p>One of the ways I prioritise my own mental health is to set clear boundaries at work.

Debt is a significant risk factor of suicide. Financial concerns are not always commonly discussed. Many people may feel a sense of shame about their situation or do not typically discuss personal finance with others. Therefore, the training remains relevant and more important than ever.”</p><p>In a 2023 <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/almost-20-million-adults-never-speak-about-mental-health-and-it-s-set-to-get-worse-due-to-the-cost-of-living-crisis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">survey by the charity Mind</a>, more than one in three UK adults (36 per cent) said they never make space in their day or the time to speak about their mental health. Yet nearly 8 in 10 who responded (78 per cent) said that their mental health has been affected by cost-of-living crisis – this was worse for those with existing mental health problems (94 per cent).</p><p><strong>Imran Choudhury, Chair of the Good Thinking Advisory Board and Director of Public Health at the London Borough of Sutton </strong>said:&nbsp;“We know that living and working in London can be stressful, and right now for some it may be overwhelming. That is why we want to encourage as many people as possible to take free, online training to know what to do if a loved one, colleague or stranger is in crisis.</p><p>“By doing so, we are working towards a city that is stigma free, where people can have a more direct and honest conversation about suicide with fellow Londoners in a safe and sensitive way. Especially considering the challenges so many Londoners – and particularly those from marginalised and racialised communities – have faced in recent years.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/suicide-prevention-training\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about suicide prevention training.</a></p>",

With this year’s theme being ‘Let’s connect’, we’re proud that our new Good Thinking guides will help families across London to make meaningful connections and support other people’s mental wellbeing.</p><p>Over the last five years, we’ve worked with various youth organisations, including Partnership for Young London, The Student Room, Muslim Youth Helpline and The Diana Award, to co-create Good Thinking resources based on lived experience of mental ill health. For Children’s Mental Health Week 2023, we’ve once again teamed up with Partnership for Young London to get direct input from teens and also worked with Thrive LDN to incorporate its conversation starter tips in our new guides.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of what you’ll find in the guides, which are available <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-guides/quick-guides-support-others\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

Plus, there are links to useful Good Thinking resources – including free NHS-approved wellbeing apps, such as <a href=\"/resources/clear-fear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Clear Fear</a> and <a href=\"/resources/feeling-good-teens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Good Teens</a> – and other support organisations.</p>",

It was built on in-depth user insights and we had a clear mission: use digital technologies to provide free, personalised, safe, high-quality mental health support that Londoners could access 24/7. Our initial focus was on offering clinically-validated self-assessments and NHS-approved apps.</p><p><strong><em>“It’s a really good website and for people who are a bit reluctant to speak to people, it's very good to turn to, like the advice in there really did help me, especially with the sleep so it's something I am thankful for.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>Back in 2017, no one had any idea that two enormous mental health challenges lay ahead: a global pandemic and a cost of living crisis. To help Londoners who were anxious about COVID-19 and those who sadly lost loved ones to the virus, we quickly expanded Good Thinking’s resources to include hundreds of new ‘how to’ guides, podcasts, videos and workbooks. We also worked closely with faith and belief communities across London to provide tailored wellbeing content and support. And, now, we are offering advice on dealing with the stress of rising household bills and how to remain resilient this winter.</p><p><strong><em>“I love the part about faith and belief communities… it's amazing because I didn’t find anything like that on other websites, it is very inclusive, very sensitive.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>More than 690,000 people have used the Good Thinking service over the last five years – at home, at school, at university and at work; on the bus and on the tube; in the middle of the afternoon and in the early hours of the morning. We’re extremely proud to have had almost a million total visits to our website since 2017 but we’re determined to help even more Londoners find their own path to good mental wellbeing.</p><p><strong><em>“I'd definitely recommend it as a place with useful tips for people like those moving to university, going through bereavement, children.”</em></strong> <em>Good Thinking survey respondent, October 2022</em></p><p>To mark our fifth anniversary, we’ve once again asked Good Thinking stakeholders, including users and representatives of the NHS and local government, for their feedback about the service. We’ve taken their comments and updated the look and feel of Good Thinking and made it easier to find the advice and tools you need to help you look after your mental wellbeing. We’ll unveil the refreshed Good Thinking service later this month – you can rest assured, it still has the same resources that hundreds of thousands of people already trust.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>To hear about how Good Thinking is supporting Londoners this winter, please join us at our virtual event at 11:00-12:00 on Thursday 17 November 2022. Professor Kevin Fenton, Regional Director for London at the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), will lead the discussion on the impact of the cost of living crisis on mental health and the importance of boosting community resilience through collaboration.

The past couple of years have been an extremely challenging time for everyone. Children and young people have faced disruption to their school life and education as well as long periods of separation from their friends and relatives. We’ve all had to adapt to different ways of living, working, studying and socialising – and Growing Together is about how we’ve all grown and addressed these challenges over the past couple of years, as well as how we can support one another to continue growing in the future.</p><p>Children’s Mental Health Week is led by <a href=\"https://www.place2be.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Place2Be</a>, a provider of mental health services in schools across the UK for over 25 years. They have a range of resources available throughout the week designed for parents, carers, teachers and young people themselves.</p><p>Good Thinking also has a set of resources designed to support the mental health and wellbeing of young people across London. Take a look through our <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/free-apps-young-people/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">range of free apps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">podcasts</a> specifically designed for young people. We also have <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tips for better mental wellbeing</a> on a wide range of topics, including <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/children-and-young-people-who-are-being-bullied\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bullying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople/q-eating-disorders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eating disorders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-cope-death-loved-one/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bereavement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/disinformation-misinformation-fake-news\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">identifying fake news</a>.</p><p>If you’re a <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/parents-and-carers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">parent or carer for a young person</a>, we have a range of resources designed to support you in helping your child manage anxiety, stress, sleep problems or low mood.</p><p>And if you’re a young person aged 15-25 years and are feeling up for the challenge, we’re looking for Digital Health Ambassadors to help us to ensure that young Londoners have a voice in creating change and engaging in conversations that affect public policy across the mental health space. <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more</a> and get in touch.</p>",

We’ve faced restrictions on things that we previously took for granted, such as spending time with family and friends, going on holiday and even taking part in activities that we used to enjoy when looking after our health and wellbeing, such as going to the gym, cinema or theatre. This sense of isolation and the worries and fears that some people have experienced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have put a strain on mental health and wellbeing for many of us.</p><p>Great Mental Health Day was conceived by the London borough of Haringey but now has support spanning the whole of London in collaboration with Thrive LDN and Good Thinking. The event aims to:</p><ul><li>raise awareness of the mental health services, community organisations and activities available both locally and regionally across London;</li><li>challenge stigma often associated with mental health and asking for help;</li><li>encourage frank and open conversations about mental health and wellbeing; and</li><li>sign-post Londoners to the most appropriate form of advice and help to meet their needs.</li></ul><p>Keep an eye out on our social media pages on Great Mental Health Day, where we’ll be posting information about the range of advice, guidance and support available through the Good Thinking service.</p><p>We’d also love you to get involved. Why not share a short video on social media telling us how you look after your mental health and wellbeing, destress, sleep better or reduce anxiety. Don’t forget to tag us in.</p><p><strong>Twitter</strong> - @GoodThinkingUK</p><p><strong>Facebook and Instagram</strong> - @goodthinkinguk</p><p>Use the hashtag <strong>#greatmentalhealth</strong></p><p>You can find out more about the London-wide Great Mental Health Day campaign <a href=\"https://thriveldn.co.uk/campaigns/greatmentalhealth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/subscribe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to our monthly e-newsletter</a>, offering resources, advice and guidance to help you look after your mental health and wellbeing.</p>",
