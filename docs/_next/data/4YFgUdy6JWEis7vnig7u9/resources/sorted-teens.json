Teens is a free app containing audios for building mental strength. It is a shorter, age appropriate version of our NHS-accredited adult Sorted app for 10 - 15 year olds.</p><p>Sorted Teens is super easy to use. You simply need to lie back, relax and listen, no reading required, no signing on. It can be used offline and is anonymous. It has 11 tracks of varying length from 3 minutes to 11 minutes. These audio tracks teach skills in:</p><ul><li>Muscle relaxation</li><li>Slow deep breathing</li><li>Calming the mind</li><li>Building self-confidence</li><li>Coping with exam stress</li><li>Enabling better sleep</li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"><img src=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Four_core_topics_731d2d6dde.png\" alt=\"Four-core-topics.png\"></span></p><h3><strong>How could it help me?</strong></h3><p>The audio tracks in Sorted Teens can help you build key skills for life, helping you to not only deal with mental stresses and strains, such as tests and exams, but to bounce forwards and become mentally stronger and more resilient and more confident.</p><p>The audios combine relaxation, positive psychology, and Olympic Sports coaching techniques to build core self-confidence and self-esteem. There is a short video to develop calm breathing too. Regular listening to the audio tracks builds inner mental strength, in much the same way as physical exercise builds strong flexible muscles, so listening builds a strong flexible mind - developing skills for life.</p><h3>Who is it for?</h3><p>Sorted Teens is recommended for use by 10–15-year-olds and supports development of emotional regulation, self-esteem, resilience, and goal-focused motivation.
