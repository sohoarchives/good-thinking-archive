These may include:</p><ul><li><strong>University Counselling and Mental Wellbeing Services:</strong> professional counselling and mental health advice is available to support students with therapy sessions, crisis intervention and mental health assessments.</li><li><strong>Student Support and Welfare Teams</strong>: many universities have dedicated teams offering workshops, peer support groups, and resources to help manage <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/anxiety\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anxiety</a>.</li><li><strong>academic support and personal tutors: </strong>tutors and academic advisors can offer guidance on workload management and academic related stress.</li><li><strong>student-led support networks:</strong> many universities have peer mentoring schemes and student societies focused on mental health and wellbeing.</li><li><strong>online resources and support helplines:</strong> universities often provide access to digital mental health platforms, wellbeing apps and 24/7 support lines for immediate assistance. Good Thinking also has a <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated student webpage</a> with advice and guidance on a range of&nbsp;mental wellbeing topics.</li></ul><p>It’s crucial for students to recognise that seeking support is not a sign of weakness but an essential part of maintaining good mental health.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What would be your one, key piece of advice for any student struggling with mental health?</strong></h3><p><strong>You’re not alone, and seeking support is a sign of resilience, not weakness.</strong></p><p>It’s easy to feel as though you must navigate challenges independently, but mental health difficulties do not define you. Speaking to a friend, reaching out to a counsellor, or seeking guidance from a wellbeing advisor can make a significant difference. Your mental health is just as important as your academic achievements. Prioritise self-care, practise self-compassion and remember that progress is more important than perfection.</p><h3><strong>Do you have a top tip for students who may be facing mental health challenges?</strong></h3><p><strong>Strive for balance - your wellbeing should never be compromised for academic success or to meet social expectations.</strong></p><p>Establishing a balance between academic responsibilities, social life, and personal wellbeing is fundamental to long term success. Create healthy habits, such as setting boundaries, practising <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/be-mindful\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mindfulness</a>, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and engaging in activities that bring you fulfilment. Small, consistent efforts towards self-care can have a profound impact on your overall wellbeing.</p><h3><strong>A final thought from Lorraine…</strong></h3><p>Let’s challenge the stigma surrounding student mental health and foster an environment where seeking help is encouraged and supported. Mental health is not a final destination but a continuous journey of self-awareness, growth and care. You deserve support, balance and most importantly the opportunity to thrive.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling, please don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Support is available and you are never alone on this journey.</p>"

							"content": "<h3><strong>Why is it important for students to look after their mental wellbeing?</strong></h3><p>For many students, university is an exciting time of growth, learning, and challenge. Alongside all this, though, comes the stress of assignments, deadlines, and balancing life. <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stress</a> is totally normal, and it’s designed to keep us safe in the short term. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and like you can't cope, it can be really helpful to reach out for support.</p><p>Just like we make sure to look after our physical health by showering, brushing our teeth, eating well, and exercising, it's super important to take care of our mental and emotional health too. Proactively looking after yourself means having a good routine—getting quality <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/sleep\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sleep</a>, eating well, staying active, and making time for things that help you relax and recharge. Self-care isn't just about chilling out; it’s about doing things that nourish your mind and body.</p><h3><strong>What factors can have the biggest impact on a student’s mental health?</strong></h3><p>A lot of things can affect your mental health as a student. Academic pressures, such as assignment deadlines, high workloads, and self-expectations can be a significant source of <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/anxiety\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anxiety</a>.</p><p>Worries about tuition fees, rent, food, and other living costs can weigh heavily, and many students also feel a sense of social isolation when they move away from home and struggle to form new friendship circles which can affect self-esteem and emotional health.</p><p>Poor <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/sleep\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sleep</a> habits due to late-night studying or socialising can make you <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/low-mood\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feel low</a> and affect your mood.</p><p>And finally, not knowing where to go for help or feeling embarrassed to ask for support can prevent you from reaching out when you need it.</p><h3><strong>Where can students go for mental health advice and support at university?</strong></h3><p>Everyone has different ways they like to be supported. You might feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, or you might prefer speaking to a tutor. But if you need extra help, there are other sources of support too.</p><ul><li><strong>Student Wellbeing Services:</strong> most universities have these services, where you can get confidential advice.</li><li><strong>GP or NHS services:</strong> your GP can refer you to mental health services, including therapy such as <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/nhs-talking-therapies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS Talking Therapies.</a></li><li><strong>Confidential helplines:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/talk-us-phone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Samaritans,</a> <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helplines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind</a>, <a href=\"https://nightline.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nightline</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.studentminds.org.uk/findsupport.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Student Minds</a> are just a few examples of services that offer support over the phone, via text, or email.</li><li><strong>Peer support:</strong> student societies, mentors, or support groups can also offer a listening ear.</li></ul><p>And remember, if you ever feel completely overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to access <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/urgent-support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">urgent support.</a></p><h3><strong>What would be your one piece of advice for students who may be struggling with their mental health?</strong></h3><p><strong>Talk to someone you trust</strong>. It can be tough, but opening up can be the first step towards feeling better. Whether it’s a friend, family member, or professional, talking about how you’re feeling can make a massive difference. You’re never alone in this, and there’s always support available.</p><h3><strong>What’s your ‘top tip’ for student mental wellbeing?</strong></h3><p><strong>Be kind to yourself.</strong> It's easy to be hard on yourself when things aren’t going well, but you wouldn’t talk to a close friend the way you sometimes talk to yourself. Try to be patient and compassionate with yourself, even when things feel tough. Take small steps—whether that’s going for a walk, getting some fresh air, or just taking a break. It all counts, and even tiny actions can make a big difference. And remember, support is always there when you need it.</p><h3><strong>A final thought from Kerry…</strong></h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.suffolkmind.org.uk/advice-information/the-mental-health-continuum/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health Continuum</a> (shown in the diagram below) is a really useful way to think about mental wellbeing. It shows how we move along a mental health ‘scale’ depending on what’s happening in our lives. For example, you could be feeling in the green “healthy” zone most of the time, but we all have moments when we dip down a bit too. And that’s okay—what matters is how we deal with it.</p><p><img src=\"/good-thinking-archive/assets/Mental_Health_Continuum_89540f63aa.png\" alt=\"Mental Health Continuum.png\"></p>"

							"content": "<h3><strong>What factors can impact on student’s mental health and why?</strong></h3><p>Poor mental health can affect students at any stage of their university life. Many factors can impact student wellbeing, including academic pressure, financial stress, social challenges, and digital media consumption. </p><p>Balancing deadlines, coursework, and exams can be overwhelming, leading to <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/anxiety\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anxiety</a> and burnout. Financial concerns, such as tuition fees and living expenses, add another layer of <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a>, particularly for students managing part-time jobs alongside studies. </p><p>Social wellbeing also plays a role—<a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/advice/how-to-cope-loneliness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">loneliness</a>, homesickness, or difficulties in forming friendships can lead to feelings of isolation. Additionally, excessive social media use can negatively impact self-esteem, as students compare themselves to others or feel pressure to stay constantly connected.</p><h3><strong>Where can students go for mental health advice, support and guidance at university?</strong></h3><p>Universities provide various resources to support student mental health. Most institutions have mental health and wellbeing teams offering professional guidance, whether through one-to-one sessions, group workshops or self-help resources. At Middlesex University, students can access mental health advisor support and short-term counselling, as well as a range of initiatives focused on the specific and diverse needs of our student population. These include: workshops for LGBT+ students; self-regulation groups for those with sensory needs; and stress management workshops, particularly for those in high-pressure environments like placements. </p><p>We also promote third party digital resources, such as content from partner organisations like the <a href=\"https://studentspace.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Student Mind’s ‘Student Space’ platform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Thinking</a>, both of which offer things like NHS mental health articles and vetted <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/student-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wellbeing apps</a> that are free for students to use.</p><h3><strong>What would be your one top tip for students struggling with their mental health and wellbeing?</strong></h3><p>If you’re struggling with your mental health and wellbeing, my top tip would be to think about your wellbeing holistically. At Middlesex University, we’ve produced a <a href=\"https://emea.radiusbycampusmgmt.com/crm/viewImage?id=5006000134620184&amp;fileName=%2FWellbeing%2FWellness+Model.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wellness model</a> that gets students to think about all aspects of their lives when it comes to self-care. This includes your emotional, physical, social, occupational and financial wellness. When you reflect on each area of your life, you can identify where you’re doing well and where there are areas for improvement. We then encourage students to prioritise ‘keystone’ habits and goals, which are the ones that will allow other things in your life to fall into place. Examples of keystone habits or goals are:</p><ul><li><strong>learning how to manage time</strong> - to prioritise tasks better and avoid undue stress;</li><li><strong>limiting social media usage</strong> - to manage distractions and emotional challenges around comparing yourself to others;</li><li><strong>setting weekly self-care time</strong> - to allow yourself a chance to reflect and be mindful about where you are and where you’re going;</li><li><strong>reducing exposure to news</strong> - if negative news is impacting you in an emotionally challenging way.</li></ul><p>Choosing to focus on between one and three new habits at any one time is a proven way to make you more likely to stick to them, while improving your overall wellbeing.</p>"
