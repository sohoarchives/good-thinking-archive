As the organisation’s counselling sessions are only 50 minutes once a week and clients had other matters they wanted to discuss, there were limitations on how much time could be devoted to explaining the benefits of Good Thinking.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"944","title":"Lessons learnt","content":"<ol><li><strong>Language is a barrier: </strong>As English is not the primary language of many of the clients that Alternatives Trust East London supports, this posed a significant barrier to effectively understanding the range of resources available through Good Thinking. Whilst some Good Thinking resources *such as the range of faith and belief guides) are translated into a range of community language, this isn’t replicated across the board, which poses limitations to understanding. As one client commented, <strong><em>“It would be useful to have the website fully in my language. Sometimes when I read the English I don’t really understand.”</em></strong></li><li>&nbsp;<strong>It’s important to have a range of resources: </strong>Having access to practical workbooks and guides was particularly useful for Alternatives’ clients. They also found the faith-based information helpful as a way of reflecting about mental health in their faith. The mindfulness activities, videos and podcasts were also very helpful.’ One client noted, <strong><em>“I like the videos and podcasts. I like listening to others talk and understand things better through this way. It makes me feel like I am not struggling on my own with depression.”</em></strong></li><li><strong>There’s a ripple effect: </strong>The Alternatives clients who were introduced to Good Thinking said they found the platform very beneficial for the entire family. In the counselling sessions, clients were keen to discuss how Good Thinking resources help to promote good mental health and wellbeing, not only for them but for their children and other family members. As one client said, <strong><em>“I will continue to use the tools in the Good Thinking programme. I like to read through things with my older daughter. I feel like we support each other.”</em></strong></li></ol>"},{"id":"945","title":"Next steps","content":"<p>The Alternatives team will continue to direct clients to the Good Thinking website during counselling sessions so they can explore a particular mental health challenge together and continue using the resources at home.</p>"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
