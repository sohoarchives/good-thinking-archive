This extra effort can strain the brain, which directly influences decision-making, thought processes and behaviours. </span></p><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">Children and teenagers are especially worried about their future. What kinds of emotions are they experiencing and what can be done to help them?</strong></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">Young people are experiencing an array of fluctuating emotions, including anxiety, powerlessness, betrayal and anger. But some also feel hopeful that things can get better.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">It’s important for spaces to be created for young people to feel these emotions – they might find it helpful to reflect in a climate-specific guided journal, speak to other young people in </span><a href=\"https://www.climate.cafe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: white;\">climate cafés</a><span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"> or take part in climate action in their local communities.</span></p><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">What advice would you give to Londoners to help them cope with climate anxiety and become more resilient?</strong></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">When we talk to people experiencing the psychological impacts of climate change, the main thing they need is social support and a sense of community. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">So, my advice would be to get involved with climate actions in your community and talk to someone about how you are feeling. Doing something for the local environment is a win-win for the community and for your own mental health and wellbeing.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6); background-color: white;\">If you need </span><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/urgent-support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: white;\">urgent support</a><span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">, there are 24/7 mental health helplines available to help.

Here are some tips to get you started:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Stay active – you could even combine exercise with positive climate action by cycling or walking rather than using your car or public transport.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Connect with other people at a </span><a href=\"https://www.climate.cafe/\" rel=\"noopener

talk about your feelings and concerns together.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Incorporate some new habits into your daily life – perhaps you could eat more plant-based meals, cut out single-use plastics or shop second-hand?</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Volunteer for a local environmental charity or join a campaigning organisation.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Use a meditation or mindfulness app to help you focus on the present moment and cope with feeling overwhelmed or anxious.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Learn about key climate issues – there are lots of great podcasts, videos and books on this subject.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Keep a journal in which you write down your thoughts and emotions about the climate crisis, reflect on them and find your own ways to take action.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Spend time in nature and, if you have a garden or balcony, make it more wildlife-friendly.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Try to balance your news and social media intake – follow people with different viewpoints and take regular timeouts from your digital devices.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Climate anxiety is known to cause sleep problems, such as insomnia, so try to develop good sleep habits (e.g. switching off your tech at night and sleeping in a dark, quiet bedroom).</span></li></ol>"},{"id":"839","title":"Good Thinking resources","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/anxiety\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"
