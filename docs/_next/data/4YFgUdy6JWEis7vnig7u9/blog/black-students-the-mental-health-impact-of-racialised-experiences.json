Some of these challenges we encounter in the wider society (e.g. racism, stereotyping, prejudice and/or <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/blog/impact-of-racial-microaggressions-on-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">microaggressions</a>); some are encountered specifically as a black student in the academic world (e.g. cultural conflicts with academic texts, under-representation in teaching staff and lack of academic and social support).&nbsp;</p><p>Very often, these racialised experiences are dismissed, ignored or denied. But the impact of these racialised encounters can increase a black student’s vulnerability to mental health difficulties and can contribute to depression, anxiety, anger, withdrawal, physical illness, substance misuse and even psychosis.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"495","title":"Stigma and looking out for your mental health as a black student","content":"<p>The opportunity to express your experience of the world is crucial to positive mental functioning but seeking mental health support is difficult for many black people. Without an opportunity to express your experience, pressure builds which can cause anxiety, isolation and a feeling of suffering in silence.&nbsp;</p><p>The history of slavery and colonialism and the internalised historical narrative of black people being strong supports the notion that mental health difficulties are a form of weakness. Today, the dynamics of race and the remnants of those traumatic histories continue. Black people are often treated as not having emotions and vulnerabilities in interactions with police or mental health services. Therefore their interactions with both the police and mental health services may be problematic and can lead to mistrust in these services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of routes to treatment for mental and emotional problems, black people are almost five times as likely as white people to be detained under the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/mental-health/detentions-under-the-mental-health-act/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health Act</a>. The stigma around mental health in black communities and mistrust of support services offered by white institutions are key factors in mental health problems not being recognised or supported early enough. But racial discrimination also has an impact – as the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/763547/Modernising_the_Mental_Health_Act___increasing_choice__reducing_compulsion___summary_version.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Independent Review of the Mental Health Act </a>notes, \"structural factors which engender racism, stigma and stereotyping increase the risk of differential experiences [of mental health care] in ethnic minority communities\".&nbsp;</p><p>The need for a range of culturally appropriate avenues and treatments for mental ill health plays a role in countering black people’s resistance to finding support. In the black community, faith-based practices offer some black students support and strength during their studies. Seeing difficult experiences through this lens can help immensely and be a great source of comfort, resilience and self-worth. However, it should also be noted that these are not available to people who do not share the same faith and can be difficult to access. Also, in some instances, faith-based institutions can become a place of anxiety for some people and can create conditions that make a person feel less secure sharing their concerns about their mental health.</p><p>Mental health is often framed negatively in a way that involves professionals or medication when things get to a crisis stage. But we all have mental health and everyone’s mental health is on a scale between positive and negative mental functioning. It is important to recognise that prevention is better than cure and there are many things that you, as a black student, can do to protect and manage your mental health.</p>"}]},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"475","content":"<h2>What will I get out of this blog?</h2><p>This guidance is not ‘one size fits all’.

These representations derive from falsehoods created to justify slavery and colonialism by diverting attention away from the aggression that black people encountered daily. Today, stereotyped representations of being strong, sexual and savage – the angry black woman or the aggressive black male – maintain the belief that black people are to be feared.&nbsp;</p><p>Damaging racial stereotypes also present black people as having low intelligence. The dominance of these representations can then limit the potential of black people and cause a collective internalisation of stereotypes (e.g. hyper-masculinity which deters many black men from showing emotion and seeking support and results in them suffering in silence).&nbsp;</p><p>Internalised racist stereotypes can also affect how black people feel about pursuing academic learning or narrow their perspective of what it means to be black.

You may also feel unseen by other students and staff, black or otherwise. These encounters can result in a feeling of isolation, impact your self-esteem and cause you to withdraw.&nbsp;</p><p>If your disability is invisible, symptoms can often be misinterpreted and seen through the lens of racial stereotypes. For example, the difficulty with sitting still for someone with ADHD is more easily interpreted as expected disruptive behaviour. As a result, black students with invisible disabilities can suffer higher levels of disciplinary action from the university whilst studying.</p><h3>Positive mental health practices</h3><ul><li>Self-disclose as soon as possible.You may feel unsure about this but if you do, it will help your lecturers and the course team to understand your needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Explain your needs to disability services and learn what resources are available for you.&nbsp;</li><li>Find a community that understands and supports you (this could be either inside or outside university).</li><li>Ask disability services to liaise with your tutor to find the best support for you.</li><li>If you suspect that you have an invisible disability, go to student services for support.</li></ul>"},{"id":"485","title":"Black LGBTQ+ students","content":"<p>There are many distinct identities within the LGBTQ+ community (e.g. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or sometimes questioning, other).

This can come from the wider university community but also from within the black community and the LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a black gay or lesbian student, homophobic remarks and language can make you feel unsafe and unaccepted in the black community whilst there can also be a lack of understanding and racist notions from non-black queer people, which can result in feeling victimised and socially excluded.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on your intersectionality, access to the LGBTQ+ community can also be affected. As a black trans student, you may encounter racist notions about black people’s bodies alongside your gender expression not being accepted.

In addition to the culture shock and xenophobia that might be experienced by non-black international students, black students may also experience additional forms of discrimination and racism.

However, without self-care, these pressures can become overwhelming, affect your motivation and impact your mental health.&nbsp;</p><h3>Positive mental health practices</h3><ul><li>Try to keep connected to family and friends and take them on the journey with you.</li><li>Remember that there are people who you can identify with and who want you to succeed.&nbsp;</li><li>Take time to create new networks and take part in activities that you enjoy outside your direct learning (e.g. social events and exercise).</li><li>Empower yourself through your community. Stay present and relate to what is real to you.&nbsp;</li><li>Take some time for yourself and practice self-care. This can be whatever appeals to you – exercise, meditation, cleaning, reading, watching TV, listening to music, sleeping, walking, etc.</li></ul>"},{"id":"491","title":"Balancing university life","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincome/financialyearending2019#:~:text=The%20original%20income%20of%20people,the%20lowest%20average%20original%20income).\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In the UK</a>, white household incomes are, on average, 63% higher than black household incomes. This inequality causes many black students to experience greater financial pressures and they have to balance the conflicting demands of bringing in sufficient income alongside meeting the requirements to pass the course. A black student's experience of university can therefore be quite different from their white counterparts.</p><p>You may be living in a family home and have dependents (e.g. a child, parent or relative) or younger siblings living with you who are not aware of the demands of your course. In these situations, the environment at home can be distracting and not ideal for study. There can also be cultural expectations to contribute to the running of&nbsp;the home (e.g. cooking dinner, shopping, cleaning, looking after siblings or a relative). These additional responsibilities are often culturally significant for black students but might not be understood as impacting your ability to focus on study. It can feel difficult when trying to explain this to a white lecturer who doesn't have this cultural point of reference and can make you feel as though you are inadequate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Positive mental health practices</h3><ul><li>Check in with your university to see if it offers a time management course – this could help you not only in your studies but in your life after university.</li><li>Look out for scholarships specifically for black students. Identifying your heritage in university will help with exposure to any scholarship programmes available to you.</li><li>Find out if your university offers a mentoring programme.</li></ul>"},{"id":"493","title":"Social media","content":"<p>Social media can have many benefits. It can help you to develop better social skills and stay connected, feel less isolated, broaden your knowledge of societal ideas and issues outside of your immediate social group, share your ideas with friends and have fun. But social media can also have negative impacts.&nbsp;</p><p>There has been an increase in racially discriminatory material on social media. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460322002349\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a> showed that exposure to racial discrimination either directly or indirectly increases anxiety, depressive symptoms and substance and alcohol misuse in social media users. As a young black person, responding to racial discrimination can feel empowering but over-immersion in this material can have the opposite effect and may increase anxiety and depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</p><h3>Positive mental health practices</h3><ul><li>Manage when and where you use social media.&nbsp;</li><li>Be mindful that your self-validation is not caught up in social media.</li><li>Take social media breaks for a day or more. This will help you to manage your use and avoid getting too absorbed online.&nbsp;</li><li>Recognise the things that upset you or trigger insecurities and curate your feed to help you avoid them.</li></ul>"}]},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"474","content":"<h2>Useful resources</h2>","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsInfoTabs","id":"95","tabs":[{"id":"516","title":"Good Thinking resources","content":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental health and wellbeing support for students</a> - check out Good Thinking’s range of advice and support to help you to stay mentally healthy at college and university</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/advice/exam-stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stressed about exams?
