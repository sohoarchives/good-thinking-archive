I also struggled for many years without an autism diagnosis, which made accessing certain support services impossible. There wasn’t really a cohesive master list or centralised area of information and this made it hard for me to know what to do or where to go for help.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, I have a marvellous sister who’d already completed an undergraduate degree and who provided some guidance. But many of my neurodivergent classmates and peers weren’t so fortunate. If you don’t know the right people, it can be difficult to know where to start.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I asked the Good Thinking team if I could write a blog about my experience at London South Bank University that includes all the useful information and tips I have gathered over the past three years. I also spoke to my autistic peers to get a better idea of what I should include.</p><h3>Advice and tips from my own experiences</h3><p>For the autistic students starting or continuing their higher education in 2023/24, I hope the advice in this blog helps you to be the best you can be:&nbsp;</p>",

							"content": "<p>Applying for a place at university can feel very overwhelming at first. It’s a big turning point and you have to make a lot of important decisions. Some of my peers struggled to find explicit definitions of key terms relevant to the application process. The <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/ucas-terms-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website outlines these but I’ll also explain each term I use in this blog.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal statement </strong></p><p>One of the things you need to include in your university application is a ‘personal statement’. This is a summary (up to 4000 characters) in which you explain why you’re applying for your chosen course and highlight your unique experiences and passions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When writing your personal statement, it’s good to map out application deadlines so you complete everything on time. If you struggle with unfamiliar tasks, you might like to ask a teacher or friend to support you with the application process.</p><p>The ‘Applying to university’ section on the <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-to-university\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website is very useful. It includes advice about when to apply, how to fill in your application and how to obtain references. The <a href=\"https://www.studential.com/personal-statement-examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Studiential</a> website offers course-specific personal statement examples but be careful of plagiarism – you want your personal statement to be your own.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Open days</strong></p><p>I also recommend attending the open days at your chosen universities as tours of the campus and accommodation can help you familiarise yourself with the new environment. Virtual tours have a similar effect and are good if you live far away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During Sixth Form, I found it really helpful to attend taster lectures relevant to Psychology as it gave me an idea of what university learning would look and feel like. Lecture theatres are a lot bigger than your average classroom and I personally prefer to sit in the back corner so I can see everything that’s going on. I even practised taking notes to get an idea of the kind of resources I might need to support me during my classes.&nbsp;</p>"

							"content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website offers general guidance about university life but I find that other autistic people’s experiences (on personal blogs like this one and in YouTube videos) are really valuable. If you can’t find what you need, try asking other autistic students who you know or post a comment or question on <a href=\"https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Student Room</a> website.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Student finance</strong></p><p>One of the most important things to sort out early on is how you’ll finance your studies and living costs. You might need to complete a student finance application, which provides you with a student loan for your tuition fees that is paid directly to your university. Someone else can apply for this on your behalf but you would need to give permission for them to do this. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to support your living costs while you are studying. This is dependent on your household income but students on a low income or those who are care leavers might receive additional financial support. Extra funding might also be available for students on specific courses.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to reapply for student finance every year. I tended to do this in late Spring because it helped me get an idea of my budget and meant that I wasn’t worried about my loans dropping late. You can find out more about applying for student finance on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/student-finance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UK Government</a> website.</p><p>When setting up your student finance, you’ll be given the option to apply for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)</a>. This funding is for people with a mental health problem, long-term illness or disability so you’ll need to provide your autism diagnosis or proof of long-term disability. Unlike the student loan, this allowance doesn’t need to be paid back. My DSA funded frequent support outside of the support I received from my university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to take to class</strong></p><p>Knowing what you need for your classes depends on the course you’re taking but it’s typically a good idea to bring:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A notebook for each module so you can keep your notes separate&nbsp;</li><li>A planner, if you use one&nbsp;</li><li>A pencil case (I reckon an exam-style pencil case is easier than lugging all of your stationery around but I’m guilty of doing both!)&nbsp;</li><li>Any reading or writing aids you use (e.g. coloured overlays, glasses, laptops or tablets)&nbsp;</li><li>A water bottle&nbsp;</li><li>Lunch or a snack if you’re going to be out all day&nbsp;</li><li>Any medication you’ll need to take</li><li>A backpack that fits everything in it (a laptop compartment is GREAT if you’ll be bringing a device with you)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As part of of the support I received from my university, I was given a laptop with dictation and mind map software on it, a portable charger, noise cancelling headphones and a printer to scan and print my essay plans and coursework briefs!</p><p><strong>Learning styles</strong></p><p>Watching ‘day in the life’ YouTube videos of people on similar courses can be helpful as you might find some people with similar learning styles to you.&nbsp;</p><p>I struggled to organise tasks and deadlines so I bought a planner, some 'to do’ lists, and a handful of notebooks for all my rough thoughts. Breaking large tasks down into&nbsp;smaller steps made them a lot less overwhelming to tackle. Conversely, it sometimes made it difficult to get started!&nbsp;</p><p>To combat this, I did a lot of body doubling with my friends who lived nearby. This is a productivity technique where you and someone else sit together and each work through your own tasks. Body doubling even works quite well over the phone!</p>"

You can call or email to let them know in advance that you require some reasonable adjustments to access your course. They’ll likely have a form for you to fill in or will invite you to a meeting to discuss what you need. You should also let the accommodation team know to ensure that additional support is available for you off campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good to do this sooner rather than later. I had all my support set up the moment I knew which university I would be going to, which meant everything was in place for when I started that Autumn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some universities offer screenings for specific learning difficulties (SpLDs), such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. This varies uni to uni with some even offering autism assessments for those who are undiagnosed so it’s good to check the university website to see what is available. One of these screenings picked up that I had ADHD and later resulted in me being identified as autistic. Getting a diagnosis can help you access the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)</a>.</p><p>Although I am more than my labels, learning more about ADHD and autism meant I could address how my study habits and available support were failing to acknowledge how I think and learn differently. I was always aware I was autistic as many of my siblings are but the diagnosis was surprisingly clarifying and affirming for me. Prior to this, my autism was disregarded throughout my education and I was relieved to know that it wasn’t just the “me problem” that everyone had lead me to believe. I now relate so much more to many old and new autistic friends who understand my communication and sensory needs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Connecting with others</strong></p><p>At LSBU, my Autism Specialist Mentor helped me structure my course deadlines and work at a pace that was viable and appropriate for me, ensuring I didn’t get burnt out. She also liaised with my university disability team and my Personal Tutor on my behalf when I could not. I also had a Study Skills tutor who helped me structure my essay plans and who would routinely check on my progress to make sure I was staying on track.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good to communicate with your personal tutor, lecturers and seminar leaders about what you may need support with. Never be afraid to ask the questions that you need to ask! If they can’t help you with something, they’ll let you know or they’ll direct you to people who can. Better to be safe than sorry. You might need to follow up with these communications, as the inboxes can be swamped. I found it difficult to remember to do this so I’d set reminders on my phone and write it on my daily task lists. Some email accounts will also prompt you to follow up an email that has yet to receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Making new friends</strong></p><p>Socialising and making new friends at university isn’t easy for every autistic person. I put a note introducing myself on the door of my accommodation, which made meeting my flatmates less nerve-wracking. I also recommend finding clubs and societies that cater to your interests as you’ll likely find a lot of likeminded people there. If you don’t find one that you’d like to join, why not start your own?&nbsp;</p>"

							"content": "<p>You might be expected to do a lot of things independently once you’re living in student accommodation so it’s useful to familiarise yourself with these things before you move in. Some independent living tasks may not come naturally to you and that’s okay! We all learn things at different times and at different speeds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to pack</strong></p><p>Student accommodation can be unpredictable and it can be hard to know what to take with you. The <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/student-life/starting-university-or-college/list-absolutely-everything-you-need-take-university-or-college\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website might offer some clarity on what things you will need and some accommodation providers will send you a list of things they recommend packing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few suggestions from me and my friends (but remember, you can always get more things later so don’t overbuy!):</p><ul><li>Spare phone charger&nbsp;</li><li>Portable charger&nbsp;</li><li>Headphones (noise cancelling ones if you’re sensitive to sounds)&nbsp;</li><li>Sunglasses for bright lights&nbsp;</li><li>Hand sanitiser&nbsp;</li><li>Wet wipes&nbsp;</li><li>At least two of every plate/fork/spoon etc so that when one is dirty you have a backup!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A padlock for your cupboards in the kitchen (don’t be ashamed to assert your things as your own especially if you don’t like other people touching your things)</li><li>Fidget toys</li><li>Familiar items from home (these can make the environment easier to adjust to)</li><li>First aid kit (the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/what-should-i-keep-in-my-first-aid-kit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS</a> website has a good list of what to keep in it)</li></ul><p>Things can be loud, quiet, dirty, sticky, busy, echoey in student accommodation but it’s hard to know that until you’re there so pack with your own sensory requirements in mind. Try to have to enough of your medication and prescriptions to last until you register with a GP or pharmacy closer to uni, especially if you find these things difficult to sort out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cooking and cleaning</strong></p><p>I saved a bunch of recipe websites and videos to give me some ideas on what I could cook for myself. Practising these recipes was key but it took some getting used to the stove at my accommodation as it was different to what I had at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Some student accommodation offers partial catering and will provide breakfast and lunch either as part of your rent or for an additional fee. Some will clean common areas in your flat or even your room! Nevertheless, it’s good to know how to clean up after yourself as it could prevent any accidental damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.unihomes.co.uk/blog/how-to-deep-clean-your-student-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unihomes blog</a><strong><em> </em></strong>offers cleaning advice for students and a list of cleaning products that are worth purchasing. There are also lots of helpful videos online – cleaning videos on TikTok provided me with some visual examples for tasks I found difficult to picture in my head.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend uses a cleaning app called <a href=\"https://sweepy.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sweepy</a> to help with their problems with object permanence. It lets you know how clean everything is and can help you stay on track of cleaning tasks by sending notifications to your phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Budgeting</strong></p><p>Working out how much money you need for rent, food, travel, laundry and any other recurring expenses is a good way to live within your means.</p><p>I recommend setting a budget for your weekly or monthly shops so that you don’t spend more than you can afford. I wrote a shopping list every week and kept a list on my phone of things that needed to be replaced. It’s easy to find apps that can help you with this (e.g. figuring out recipes based on what you have in the house or keeping track of when certain food items are due to expire). Try to limit the number of ready meals you buy as it’s cheaper to make food yourself but I did find they came in handy when I was working to tight deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Remember to consider the sources of income you have, such as your student loans, DSA or any jobs you are working. If you’re struggling, find out whether your university offers a hardship fund or bursary.</p>"

Learning how to live independently, studying in a structured educational environment and developing my understanding of the topics I have been interested in throughout my life was an enriching experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I loved my time at university and have made friends and developed in ways I will never forget. I benefitted most from being as open as I could be to the services that could support me. The support I managed to set up before I even started at LSBU ensured that I hit the ground running.</p><p>To all autistic readers of this blog, I am so proud of you for considering the pursuit of higher education. Very few of us are enrolled in university – and even lower numbers of us complete our degrees – but I think that knowing what support is there can help us make sure our universities understand what we need. I believe in all of us and in our ability to achieve in an environment that is prepared to support us.</p>",
