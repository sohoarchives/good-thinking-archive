place - friendship, mental health and pride","content":"\u003cp\u003eLast year, I learned that being there for someone doesn’t always mean saying the right thing. Sometimes, it just means being a quiet, safe space. It’s not about having the perfect advice or being a “hero”, it’s about listening, being present, and holding space for someone when they need it most.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve realised that I often carry around pre-prepared, generic advice, the kind you hear in movies or read online. But when it comes to real conversations, especially around mental health, speaking before listening can do more harm than good. People struggle in different ways. They carry different fears, traumas, and mental health struggles, and nobody wants to be talked at when they’re already feeling unheard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my friend, Pride Month was both a celebration and\u0026nbsp;a challenge. The pressure from social media and TV to be loud and unapologetic and carefree contrasted with their feelings of depression, struggles with self-worth and fear of being rejected. They didn’t feel ready to be loud and unapologetic - and that’s okay. Pride should be about embracing where you are on your journey, not where others expect you to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of jumping in with solutions or trying to fix everything, I’ve found that just sitting beside someone quietly and without pressure can be the most powerful thing you can do. You don't need to make a speech and you shouldn't expect anything in return. Just being present is very powerful. Being a good friend, not just during Pride Month but at any stage of their journey isn't about doing it perfectly but doing it gently and sensitively.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"id":"914","title":"Tanya's story: Being 'loud and proud' isn't the only way to celebrate who we are","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs a young person in London I have struggled with my sexuality and gender.

Moving to a leafy street in Hampstead sounds idyllic but many of the patients struggled with failed placements, becoming unwell and being readmitted – a prime example of the revolving door syndrome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother area of change has been the move from prescribing strong medications such as chlorpromazine (bright orange and poured from the heaviest of bottles!). These medications provided relief of symptoms but unsurprisingly caused major side effects. When the newer antipsychotic medications were introduced, I watched as one of the most unwell and disturbed patients stabilised, without being over-sedated, and revealed her true personality – funny and very cheeky! These medications have enabled many people to leave hospital and lead much more independent lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere have also been massive advances in technology in the past decade or so. Options for more varied interventions such as phone and online, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, have really helped with the uptake of services particularly for anxious or housebound clients. The introduction of wellbeing services have brought other benefits, such as Navigators and Employment teams – a fabulous and hard-working crew of people who frankly made my life easier and reduced the number of hours I have had to spend on the phone to the benefit office!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think public attitudes to mental health have changed since you entered the profession?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking back, I recall the attitudes and fears of the public towards patient integration back into the community.\u0026nbsp;There were sadly several high-profile cases involving seriously mentally ill people, concerns around failings in community care and the general media demonisation of the mentally ill as dangerous.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last ten years, societal attitudes to mental health have changed significantly -\u0026nbsp;from limited understanding, fear and mistrust about mental health, to being able to talk openly at work and with friends about mental wellbeing or seeking direct help with mental health. There’s also been an increase in community and ‘self help’ resources that people can access themselves online, such as the NHS Good Thinking website, helping to establish strategies to manage difficult symptoms such as anxiety and panic. These resources can help people to build resilience and reduce the reliance and pressure on hospital interventions. However, more active interventions to support those with severe mental illness are still needed. The continued development of Complex Emotional Needs services and a move towards Trauma Informed Care has been helpful both for the clients, as well as improving understanding for mental health professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you were to choose a defining moment in your career, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA highlight of my career was helping to set up an outreach team in a rehabilitation unit-based in Hampstead supporting clients through the process of their discharge.

One of my biggest concerns is the widespread denial of climate change and how some people don’t realise the negative impact of their actions. It’s also alarming to see how many people are already suffering because of it, particularly in countries with fewer resources. When I think about places like Jakarta, which are already feeling the effects but don’t have the means to protect themselves, it makes me feel both angry and anxious. I also feel frustrated because I often see that the younger generation is expected to fix a problem that we didn’t create, while those who caused it seem to ignore it. This leads to a sense of hopelessness but, at the same time, it motivates me to try and make a difference.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eDo you think London faces any unique challenges when it comes to climate change?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eIt’s a very densely populated city and, with so many cars on the road, this contributes significantly to air pollution, despite efforts like the ULEZ. London also attracts a lot of tourists, and the number of flights and airports here contributes to a huge amount of CO2 emissions. Plus, the city’s infrastructure is not always geared towards sustainability—there are still problems with waste management, and the sheer volume of rubbish in some areas is staggering. Another issue is that policies like ULEZ, although positive in reducing pollution, can hit lower-income people harder because they may not be able to afford electric cars. So, while London is taking steps in the right direction, there are still challenges in balancing sustainability with social equity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eHow has climate change impacted you or your community?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003ePersonally, I haven’t faced drastic effects yet, but I’ve noticed the more extreme weather patterns affecting people around me. I see families struggling to afford the extra heating costs during colder spells, and that really highlights the economic divide when it comes to climate change. People from lower-income backgrounds are hit hardest, and it’s frustrating to see them dealing with issues like rising energy bills while the wealthier people can afford the green alternatives. The extreme weather is more than just an inconvenience – it impacts everyday life in ways that people don’t often think about. And while London has good public transport, I’ve noticed that it’s still not as green or efficient as it could be, and that makes it harder for people to make eco-friendly choices.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eWhat changes would you like to see in your local area to address climate issues?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eI’d like to see a lot more emphasis on waste management and recycling in my neighbourhood. It seems like there’s always rubbish on the streets, and it feels like the system isn’t working as well as it should. More frequent collection of waste would help reduce pollution, and I think there should be stronger rules about recycling, so people are more encouraged to do it properly. I’d also like to see more bike lanes and infrastructure to support cycling, especially since it’s a much greener alternative to driving. More green buildings would also be a great change – buildings that retain heat in winter would be especially helpful for families who need to save on energy costs. Overall, the focus needs to be on making sustainable options easier and more accessible for everyone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eHow do you look after your mental wellbeing when you’re experiencing climate anxiety?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"\u003eIt can definitely be overwhelming, especially when you’re constantly hearing negative news about climate change. I find that talking about it with friends or family really helps – just sharing how we feel and brainstorming what we can do about it makes me feel less helpless. Sometimes, I take a break from the news, because it can get so overwhelming, and I need to give myself some space from all the negativity.

I think the goals set for 2050 are too far off and, if we keep pushing things back, the situation is only going to get worse. We need more funding for sustainable solutions and policies that actually work – not just talk. I’d also like to see stronger enforcement around recycling and waste management. It’s not just about talking about it; it’s about taking steps to ensure that businesses and people are held accountable.

These include: workshops for LGBT+ students; self-regulation groups for those with sensory needs; and stress management workshops, particularly for those in high-pressure environments like placements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also promote third party digital resources, such as content from partner organisations like the \u003ca href=\"https://studentspace.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStudent Mind’s ‘Student Space’ platform\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGood Thinking\u003c/a\u003e, both of which offer things like NHS mental health articles and vetted \u003ca href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/student-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewellbeing apps\u003c/a\u003e that are free for students to use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would be your one top tip for students struggling with their mental health and wellbeing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re struggling with your mental health and wellbeing, my top tip would be to think about your wellbeing holistically.

You might need to complete a student finance application, which provides you with a student loan for your tuition fees that is paid directly to your university. Someone else can apply for this on your behalf but you would need to give permission for them to do this. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to support your living costs while you are studying. This is dependent on your household income but students on a low income or those who are care leavers might receive additional financial support. Extra funding might also be available for students on specific courses.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou need to reapply for student finance every year. I tended to do this in late Spring because it helped me get an idea of my budget and meant that I wasn’t worried about my loans dropping late.

This funding is for people with a mental health problem, long-term illness or disability so you’ll need to provide your autism diagnosis or proof of long-term disability.

I was always aware I was autistic as many of my siblings are but the diagnosis was surprisingly clarifying and affirming for me.

You might need to follow up with these communications, as the inboxes can be swamped. I found it difficult to remember to do this so I’d set reminders on my phone and write it on my daily task lists.

I’ve done kinesiology before and if I were to revisit counselling in the future, I would definitely wish to explore body psychotherapy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn counselling, I was often working through and bringing up a lot of past trauma. This, of course, is important for many reasons. But I got stuck. Moving away from this particular talking therapy and entering a new chapter was necessary and offered me the support and space that I needed to feel better.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Receiving help from an LGBTQ+ organisation brought me extra comfort”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, if I experience a challenging moment or situation, I know who to contact and I recognise my safe spaces that help me to feel grounded. I know to be kinder to myself and my body when I’m feeling vulnerable or distressed. For me this is invaluable and empowering.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t have known where to start with any of this if not for the support of the people at the centre. It can be easy to doubt oneself when treading a new pathway so having someone who genuinely cares and who is offering you guidance and assurance does wonders. Since these sessions, I have started to feel lighter and a sense of relief. It's been rocky at times but I feel more self-assured in the direction I’m taking.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIdentifying our needs and the type of support that is right for us is key.

While writing this blog, I’m also in the process of finishing up my final pieces of coursework for my degree! The lovely people at Good Thinking have invited me to write about my experience of beginning university in London three years ago as an 18-year-old Black Queer student.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSettling into university life and meeting new people\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting university was really nerve-wracking at first, particularly because I am also autistic. It’s an unfamiliar environment and I wasn’t\u0026nbsp;doing the same courses as my friends from sixth form. I chose to stay in university accommodation so I let the accommodation know that I was trans and kept in very good communication with their wellbeing facilities. This was to ensure I’d be one of the lucky ones who got an en suite room as I find shared facilities quite daunting and am more comfortable with my own spaces. I wanted to be stealth for a bit so I could focus on my studies rather than being preoccupied with any outcomes or reactions that I found worrisome!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first things I did when I moved in was leave a note introducing myself on the door. When I met my flatmates, I was quickly identified as “the one with the note on the door” – everyone found me really approachable after that. I struggle with small talk and can sometimes feel anxious when meeting new people so this took the edge off introducing myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI found transitioning from school to university classes particularly difficult because we were still learning remotely and social distancing due to COVID and it remained this way until my second year. This also made it difficult to meet new people and see old friends. Although my childhood friend, Alfred, went to LSBU as well, I could still feel\u0026nbsp;isolated. He stayed in a different accommodation and was on a different course so we couldn’t really relate to each other’s specific experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting university can cause a lot of your existing friendship circles to shift, especially if your friends have also gone to university. Hanging out when you’ve got to manage a new workload will look a lot different from what you are used to. I didn’t get to see my old circle of academically-ambitious friends as often after they scattered themselves across the UK. All of a sudden, the community I had been so well supported by felt harder to reach and I worried that I would struggle to find people I could so closely identify with on campus. This ended up not being that much of an issue – after COVID, we were all quite accustomed to video calls and digital hangouts. When meet ups became few and far between, I was always reassured by the fact that my loved ones were but a phone call away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFinding your community\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to feel like you belong in your immediate environment – on your course, in your accommodation and in societies and clubs that you may join. This can be difficult when you’re both Black and Queer. I found that some Black spaces were not always the most queer-inclusive and that Queer spaces were considerably less diverse than I would have hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis shouldn’t make you want to close yourself off though! Even if few and far between, I did find a few diamonds in the rough who helped me through my degree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore moving in, I researched all the clubs, activities and societies available for Black and/or Queer students, both on and off campus. Echoing other blog posts you may have read on the Good Thinking website, connecting with other Black LGBT+ students was really validating for me, especially because I wasn’t very vocal about my trans identity outside of these friendships until I started my third year (most of my university friends will likely only find out once they see this blog post!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI participated in plenty of projects focusing on enhancing the university experiences of Black and Queer students, providing insight on how to best maximise inclusivity so that the next generation of undergraduates will receive a warm welcome and plenty of adequate support. In fact, my participation in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students/LSBU-black-students-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Students Mental Health Project\u003c/a\u003e provided me with quite a few opportunities relevant to my degree and helped me feel like my input would have an impact on how certain decisions would be made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike many university gyms, mine was part of a scheme that provides the opportunity to attend the gyms at other participating universities across the country. This allowed me to go to the gym with my pre-university mates and we all know how instrumental both exercise and community are for your wellbeing!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my university also had a campus in Croydon, I was lucky to become acquainted with \u003ca href=\"http://croydondropin.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCroydon Drop In\u003c/a\u003e, which is a counselling service that offers advice, advocacy and signposting to further support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also attended London Pride events, which are a marvellously massive display of pride in our identities, demonstrating the very large and intersectional community we have built in this city. Some universities march in the parade so it is always worth looking into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGetting support from your university\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI communicated with the wellbeing and disability staff and services at my university the second I confirmed my choices. This meant that they were well-prepared to provide me with my exact support arrangements for ADHD and ASD when I began my classes. I had pretty poor experiences regarding my identity in school so I wanted to make sure I would be well-supported if I had any negative experiences that could impact my studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUniversities can often provide counselling, Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD) assessments and signposting to other useful forms of support you might not be aware of, so it’s really good to be open and honest about anything you may be going through. Keeping in good communication will also help with any coursework extensions, disability accommodations or extenuating circumstances you may need throughout your degree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBecoming part of London’s trans community\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor any trans readers, I just want you to know that the London trans community is very tight-knit and communicative.

Basically, I hold my phone and I have a conversation with myself and that's my version of journaling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI found that I can do it multiple times a day – it can be short or long; it depends how I’m feeling. I just try to make sure that I put something in there at least once a week and the key here is being consistent. I usually do it at the end of my day and it helps relax me before I go to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI always try to make sure that I’m adding in the positives from my life because I feel like journalists get so caught up in writing down the negatives or something really bad that happened to them that sometimes you can forget to put in the positives that have happened that week or that day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy advice to other people would be to find a way of journaling that works for you. I was advised to start with pen and paper and it did help me but it wasn’t something I could commit to long term. Once I figured out the voice memo journaling on my phone, it was something that I knew I could keep up with. I enjoy it. It’s kind of fun.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJournaling is something that anyone of any age can do because we all have mobile phones or some sort of personal device like a tablet or laptop.

I want to talk about how stressful it is loving someone with an alcohol dependency.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard for me to put into context just how frustrating and anxiety fuelling it is watching someone you love being sucked into the depths of addiction. I liken it to watching someone you love drown and you’re powerless to do anything about it but watch until the inevitable happens.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI spent my entire teens and early adult life right up until my dad’s inevitable death from alcohol use disorder worrying about him every day. I worried so much about him that I developed anxiety. I worried so much that it became my normal and I forgot what a stress-free life felt like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou see I loved my dad so much and I was determined to “fix” him, I wanted to help him, and I so desperately wanted control of the situation. But the reality of this situation is that I had as much control as he did. Which was zero.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy stress levels ended abruptly when we switched off his life support machine following an excessive alcohol binge. When my dad succumbed to his addiction, I felt relief. I was relieved that he was no longer suffering, and I was relieved that I no longer had to live with the constant worry and stress about my dad’s unpredictable addiction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the relief, it wasn’t quite that simple, because with relief came a gut-punching and overwhelming sense of guilt. I genuinely believed that I killed him, and I felt awful for feeling relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI lived a stressful life when my dad was alive, and I never knew how to manage it. The stigma attached to addiction and mental health caused me to keep a family secret, and the stigma attached to talking about our stresses caused my dad to drink. My dad struggled with his mental health but was too embarrassed to ask for help, so instead he chose to drown out the noise with alcohol. We practiced this outward-facing facade that everything was “perfect” and I was consumed with worrying about what others would think of my dad and us as a family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is why when we did lose my dad I decided to never hide my stresses again. I realised that brushing our stresses under the carpet with alcohol and pretending everything was fine was actually toxic for us. I now talk openly and embrace my mental health and this has aided my own recovery. I realised that we weren’t alone and that millions of others share similar stories to ours. I am now unapologetically honest about my experiences and discuss my stresses with no shame, I manage them in a healthy way, and I accept that there will always be elements of stress in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have now committed to advocating against the stigma attached to mental health and addiction, and I am determined to ensure that my dad’s death can become a catalyst for positive change.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA note from Good Thinking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSarah’s experiences growing up with stress as part of her everyday life and struggling with the stigma around talking about alcohol addiction and mental health have shaped her mission to de-stigmatise alcohol addiction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSarah is a passionate mental health advocate and founder of WarriorKind CIC, a not-for-profit mental health support network devoted to advocating positive conversations around mental health and committed to quashing the stigma attached to mental illness experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://warriorkind.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFind out more about Warriorkind\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeed help starting those difficult conversations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOpening up a conversation about mental health can feel difficult for a number of reasons; many people are uncomfortable talking about their feelings, and mental health issues are often stigmatised so people are worried that they may be judged for talking about their concerns.

The end of Ramadan is marked by Eid al-Fitr, a day for all Muslims to unite and celebrate by dressing up, visiting family and friends and, most importantly, eating great food!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA time for spiritual reflection\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many Muslims, such as myself, it is a time to reflect and reconnect with our faith. We do this through prayer, increasing our charitable activities and engaging with our local community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI, along with many other Muslims, choose to reduce the time spent on social media, watching TV and reading the news. We do this because Ramadan is a time when we enjoy focusing on reconnection with our faith and genuinely taking the time to treasure what the month can help us achieve. I have found Ramadan to be especially healing to my physical and mental health and wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eKindness and empathy\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important lessons of Ramadan is to be kind and empathetic toward one another. We're reminded of the less fortunate people around the world and within our very own communities living in poverty and suffering from great hardships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn remembrance of those less fortunate, it is commonplace for Muslims to increase our charitable donations and support as a way of giving back to those most in need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut please also remember that you can give back to those less fortunate in other ways - for example, by volunteering for local projects within the community that make a positive difference.

Our research showed that existing mental health resources were not relevant to the cultural and unique experiences that our black students faced.

The project aimed to remove the financial barriers to participation by paying student collaborators. This resulted in a student-led approach at every stage of the project, with input from a wide range of intersectional groups of black students at LSBU, including a mix of gender, sexuality, age ranges, cultural backgrounds and courses. Over 600 students contributed to our data collection to provide insight and the learning this provided allowed us to work with over 250 students to co-create resources.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSupport for black students across London\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re proud to have developed a range of podcasts, blogs and videos which address how difficult it is for black students to talk about mental health and gain access to the right support.

This is because racism is an organising structure of individual perceptions and personal experiences, which means that marginalised community members are constantly encountering racism on systemic, institutional and interpersonal levels. This can mean that, when racism is not named and properly processed, it may lead to the racist beliefs about marginalised communities, including the community a person belongs to, becoming internalised.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is internalised racism?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen racism is internalised, the person accepts the negative attitudes, beliefs, stereotypes and ideologies that the dominant society perpetuates about the marginalised racial group. The power that the dominant group holds in society enables them to determine what is correct, acceptable or normal. Any deviation from this standard is therefore labelled as incorrect, unacceptable and/or abnormal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, internalised racist beliefs can become psychologically toxic and may evoke negative emotions which can lead to the onset of mental health conditions, such as depression. Internalised oppression is linked to feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, self-doubt, helplessness and hopelessness. It is also implicated in the self-perpetuation of oppression and an anti-black bias.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInternalised oppression can emerge over time and may elicit denial and a sense of powerlessness. Some research suggests that internalised racism occurs through the shame and the humiliation that occurs when the self is repeatedly devalued. It should be noted that depression linked to racism could be suppressed rage. It might also be expressed through obesity, addictions, high blood pressure, stress or domestic violence.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eUnderstanding stereotypes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding stereotypes and the role they play in hampering thinking capacity is important when exploring racism. Stereotypes are thinking shortcuts that we all use to sort or organise objects in our social environment. These can be particularly helpful in pressurised environments as they reduce the amount of brain power we need to process the things we encounter and help us to respond with speed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem with stereotypes is that they are generalisations and therefore do not take into consideration all of the available information. As such, they can often be linked to negative outcomes for the individuals or groups associated with them. There has been a considerable amount of research indicating that being conscious of a negative stereotype which relates to a specific aspect of your identity can lead to poor or underperformance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs such, it is important to explore whether you have internalised negative stereotypes which result in internalised oppression and racism. You can begin to do this by asking yourself about how you have been racially socialised.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsInfoTabs","id":"91","tabs":[{"id":"505","title":"Racial socialisation","content":"\u003cp\u003eRacial socialisation is a process frequently initiated by black parents during their children’s childhood and adolescence.

It is important to note that racial socialisation occurs whether parents approach it actively or not.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople who have internalised racism are likely to have had little or no active or positive racial socialisation and may have passively internalised negative messaging about their racial group.

I have learnt that, if you have anxiety, this is NOT the football team you want to support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnxiety can come for me in many different forms. Whether it is a full-blown panic attack or a tiny worry in the back of my head, it’s always there. Even writing this, I’m feeling it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are lots of ways to deal with anxiety. People suggest slow breathing, facing your fears and walking straight into it or, in my case, completely running away from it and not being able to go to school for four years! Something which I do not advise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMissing school\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was 11 years old and moving to a completely new school. For most people, this would be a major cause of anxiety but I was surprisingly positive (for once). I had all my closest friends moving with me, I was excited to meet new people and I was ready to get out of the absolute nightmare I thought primary school was! Little did I know it was about to get a whole lot worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was a goofy, loud, sarcastic and abnormally tall 11-year-old – all traits I still have now – however I added one more quality, dad jokes. Yes, I know, I hate them too. My dad, however, is extremely proud that he has ruined my humour forever!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, I had just started secondary school and everything was going well, or so I thought (cue dramatic sound effect), when around five months into year 7, I woke up one morning and everything fell apart. I could not get into the car, I could not breathe, I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEverything anyone had ever told me about how to handle myself in these situations had gone flying out the window and even the thought of seeing anyone outside of my house made me burst into tears and feel overwhelmed with panic. I did not know how to control myself. I didn’t know what was happening. When was it going to end?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next two years, I didn’t attend school once. I tried many times. I got to the school and I couldn’t step inside. The same thing would happen again each time – that fear, that panic. It was as if there was a brick wall in front of me every time I tried. In the third year, I gradually went back to school for very short amounts of time, starting with 10 minutes a day sitting in a room alone and building up to one hour a day with one friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor three years of my school life, whether I was there or not, I did no work, I sat at home for the majority of the day, playing PlayStation, watching Netflix and football. Sounds great, right? Well, for some weird reason, it wasn’t. It was almost as if sitting at home all day doing nothing would fail to motivate me and stimulate my brain. Who would’ve thought?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more thing that made it even worse was that, during years 7 and 8, everyone was having bar and bat mitzvahs. For those who don’t know, this is a Jewish celebration for 12 and 13-year-old boys and girls. It involves a ceremony and a huge party, which is the only bit most kids care about. So, whilst everyone was going out every weekend having the time of their lives partying, I was at home, on my own, watching them on social media. Even now, I still struggle to go to bar/bat mitzvahs and parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGetting help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChanging things around was a long slow process. I saw around eight different counsellors/psychologists, none of whom really helped me, and many of whom I am sure were exasperated by me. I couldn’t communicate and felt misunderstood, which usually made me feel quite angry, if anything. At that point, medication proved more helpful than counselling and I’m still on a low dose now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was no ‘turning point’ for me, it was gradual. There were many meltdowns and mostly they would be with my mum, who was my ‘go to’. She understood me and spoke to me on a level that did not make me feel judged and she knew me better than anyone. She never gave up and pushed me only to a point that she knew I could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe had a plan for me. Initially it was just about getting dressed every single day into my school uniform, getting into the car, and driving to school. I didn’t need to step out of the car or go INTO school, I just needed to get there and back in my uniform. Sometimes even just getting into the car would take two hours. But we did it every single day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I was able to easily to do that (after many months), I had to get into the school and step inside the building and then come straight out and home again. It was so hard. But I knew that I would not be pushed to do any more than mum had promised. I felt safe and never tricked into doing anything. It was all about trust. I just had to step into the building and step out again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe pushed on and stuck to what we had planned to do that month. When that became easier, I had to stay in the building for five minutes. Months later, 10 minutes. Then eventually into a side room. Once I had mastered that, I felt confident enough to have a friend with me in the room (avoiding seeing anyone was a big issue for me). So mum would be in constant contact with the school telling them what the next stage was and, each time I mastered it, we would discuss between us what we thought I could manage for the next stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeginning a new ‘step’ was always very difficult but we persevered – sometimes for months, day in day out, until it became comfortable. The first time I stepped into an actual classroom after a couple of years (for five minutes) was a massive achievement and, after a month of doing that every day, it was me that asked for an increase to 15 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo you can imagine how slow the progress was but eventually I was able to manage a whole lesson! Imagine that! And so lessons and timetables were planned weekly by mum and sent to the school and I had to try to stick to the plan that we had made together. Two lessons a day, eventually half a day etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes it would get too much and I’d feel awful and a failure but then mum would not make it an issue and start afresh with me the following day. And I always had support teachers with me. So we built it up over a long period of time, extending the goal. And, when that was reached, extending it again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFamily and friends\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI consider myself very lucky. I had an extremely supportive family who wouldn’t scream or get annoyed at me whenever I panicked. I also had the best friends anyone could ask for, always looking out for me and supporting me even if they didn’t know why I wasn’t at school. Everyone cared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith parties and social events (well, there weren’t very many as these were and still can be difficult), I really wanted to go and would beat myself up beforehand for many days! But mum would say “Go, stay for half an hour only and, if you want to stay longer, then text me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMum would often get many texts from me. Some social events I would stay at, some I would come home from, and some I never made it to at all. But mum always convinced to me try – with an ‘out’ if I needed it. Somehow, throughout this whole process and the thousands of texts and meltdowns, she stuck with me and, most impressively of all, maintained her sanity and patience with me. Well, at least I think so!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI still remember one day, which really sums up how amazing my friends and family are. In year 7, when I first started missing school, the thought of telling everyone I had anxiety gave me even more anxiety, so I opted for the easy way out. I told my friends I was off because I had glandular fever. How my friends believed that I, a weird, awkward, taller-than-everyone-else 11-year-old, contracted what is predominantly known as “the kissing disease” is beyond me, but they did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI mention this because, in year 9, when I was 13 years old, I was seeing my friends a lot and slightly happier than I previously had been, so I decided I was sick of hiding, sick of lying to people and just wanted to tell the truth. I wrote a long and detailed message explaining to my friends what was really “wrong with me”. This was a huge step forward for me. My friends were incredibly understanding, offered their full support to me and didn’t judge me at all. They didn’t take it too seriously and treated me the same as they always did and, of course, constantly made jokes about it (which I wanted and loved).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore in control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat brings us to now, five years on. I am at school full time – well, as much as Boris is allowing me! I have grown as a person and really understand how to control my anxiety and deal with it. Of course, it’s not been easy. I’ve had some very tough times and have had to fight through them with the help of my family, friends and professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was able to catch up on all my work, which I found extremely stressful and daunting. I can be in lessons, be with friends and have had amazing support from the entire school to help me find my way back into being a full-time student. Luckily for me, COVID hitting allowed me to escape the nightmare of GCSEs, which was something of a blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, my anxiety hasn’t completely gone. I still have several moments and panic attacks but I have managed to control it and deal with it when the time is right, which comes naturally with experience. When it comes to panic attacks, this is not something you want but, oh well, I have them now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know anxiety can be different for everyone and everyone can have it in different ways, it’s just that mine is more serious and should be considered worse than everyone else’s (that’s one of those dad jokes I mentioned earlier).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn all seriousness, if you are reading this and you’ve dealt with or you’re dealing with anxiety or another mental health concern, here is my advice for you: Although it is different for everyone and your experience may not be the same as or even like mine, it WILL get better. I didn’t believe it when people told me either but I promise it will. Make sure you talk to people, accept support and do the things that help YOU!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, and most importantly... if you have anxiety, DO NOT SUPPORT TOTTENHAM, it will only make it worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA message from us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’d like to thank Travis for sharing his experience of anxiety with the Good Thinking community and being so honest about the challenges he faced and how he got help.

Do people always know when they’re stressed? The answer was quite surprising. And when we look further into the issue of burn out, it gets really interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMental health problems don’t announce themselves with a fanfare. Often, they creep up on you, slowly changing how you see the world and affecting how well you feel and function. It’s no easier for those around you to spot them, and the most conscientious people can struggle on silently. So, when feeling ‘not right’ many people look online, through search and social media, and the first word they tend to turn to is ‘stress’. Type stress into Google search and you will get well over a billion pages – almost three to five times the number of pages for anxiety or depression. People also search for what they feel, and at Good Thinking we’ve found a common feeling was ‘racing thoughts’ in addition to ‘constant worrying’ and ‘feeling overwhelmed’. So many people don’t actually feel stressed, but notice something different in themselves, and want to understand what it means. But often there is just a focus on work, on how much there is to do, and feeling bad about never getting to a point of feeling on top of things. The most stressed among us can just feel bad about their struggle to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMental health problems don’t announce themselves with a fanfare. Often, they creep up on you, slowly changing how you see the world and affecting how well you feel and function. It’s no easier for those around you to spot them, and the most conscientious people can struggle on silently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnchecked, stress can impact on your physical health and mental health, and in time lead to burn out. This is not a new mental health problem, but it is remarkable that burn out is occurring in surprising situations; professional video gamers and You Tubers seem to be struggling as much as public sector workers. So why would those working in the digital economy be at risk in the same way that our team members might?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe term ‘burn out’ was coined by the psychologist Herbert Freudenberger in1974; he described it as particularly relevant to caring professionals. Yet three years before in 1971, in the US, it was air traffic controllers who were commonly reporting vocational ‘burn out,’ a form of exhaustion that is noticed by a decline in quantity and quality of work. This was very similar to what doctors were later reporting, yet in a very different area of work. But why?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the 1960s and 1970s, air traffic controllers reported poor training experiences, inadequate equipment, rapidly changing shift patterns, long shifts without breaks, fatigue, monotony due to automation, and challenges arising from human-machine interfaces. Sound familiar? A huge increase in air traffic, with a small rise in the number of controllers, pushed working conditions beyond what controllers considered to be safe. After human errors were linked to fatal mid-air collisions, things started to change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearch showed though that those who ‘burnt out’ started off in a better state than their colleagues who didn’t get so stressed, and on the whole were more conscientious and competent. It seemed that workers who strive hardest to meet professional ideals may increase their risk of burnout, which then contributes to them falling to reach those ideals. Having the best ideals or goals could get in the way, causing unintentional harm to themselves or to those they are intending to help. It is sad that back then there was now way to track how you are feeling, and take steps to care for yourself better, when stress was building, and burn out a few steps away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose who ‘burnt out’ started off in a better state than their colleagues who didn’t get so stressed, and on the whole were more conscientious and competent. It seemed that workers who strive hardest to meet professional ideals may increase their risk of burnout.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a world now where we are surrounded by machines and intelligent devices, we can often experience a subtle pressure to be the same, and never properly switch off. Some people will never let their phone battery go flat, and they treat themselves the same. And the most regrettable aspect is that they then (because of our biology and psychology, our need to sleep, rest and take breaks, eat and feel the sunshine) just can’t offer the level of commitment to their work as they would like to. Yet if they could look after themselves better, everyone would benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is no judgement on anyone. I applaud you if you are one of those fine hardworking individuals who wants to make a difference and go the extra distance. This is just a plea that you use services like Good Thinking to track yourself and use the advice and tools to look after yourself better – before you begin feeling burnt out.

Our research told us that when someone is trying to make sense of what they are feeling, they are not ready to talk, but they are ready to listen. And they don’t just want to hear talk of diagnoses, medication or therapy; what helps is listening to or reading about how a mental health problem feels.

It is curious that only at this point in human history are we starting to take seriously that poor sleep is a mental and physical health problem, capable of causing terrible distress and lasting poor health consequences. At Good Thinking, we’ve started to understand better this silent, hidden epidemic and are trying to do something about it. We listened to some of those with poor sleep and what we found out was really interesting, but first let’s have a look at the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat’s the problem with not sleeping?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Many surveys show that up to 33% of the adult population have regular difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep. After depression, sleep problems are the third most common psychological reasons for appointments in general practice. Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or worsening of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes. Poor sleep doesn’t just make you feel bad, it actually impacts on your physical health and future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e33% of the adult population have regular difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInsomnia becomes a chronic problem when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is also distressed by their sleep symptoms. But how many people can talk about this distress and their sleep problem; not many we found out. It is easier to talk about anxiety and depression than it is poor sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat do Londoners say about difficulties sleeping?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Because at Good Thinking we wanted to learn from Londoners, we talked to them about their sleep and also listened to what they said online. For example, on Facebook, sleep problems were talked about by more people than anxiety or depression, but they didn’t say very much. We noticed that the poor sleepers had far fewer interactions with others about their problem; people could talk more easily about their anxiety problems, but not sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe learnt that people would post comments online in the middle of the night when they were struggling to sleep. 53% of people talked of having occasional sleep problems, whereas 28% had persistent problems. Those with persistent problems talked of feeling stressed and lonely; the sleep problems didn’t just separate them from those who could sleep, but they talked less about them, even during the day. It was as if sleep problems were something we just couldn’t talk about. Yet tiredness was the most common mental health symptom discussed on Facebook. The frustration with yourself for not being able to sleep added to the loneliness, the suffering in silence, and may have been a barrier to asking for professional help; asking for professional help was much less likely than it was for anxiety or depression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e53% of people talked of having occasional sleep problems, whereas 28% had persistent problems.

Being part of a family was no escape from the loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat was so painful about our discoveries was that many people just didn’t know what they could do, or that could make a difference. Many young adults started to have occasional problems before they 35 years old, and if not helped the occasional sleep problems became persistent, chronic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat can you do if a good night’s sleep seems an unlikely dream?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At Good Thinking, we ensured that our service offered many opportunities for people to learn more about sleep problems, and no longer feel alone with theirs. We have different tools that allow someone to assess their sleep and even thoroughly check out whether there could be a physical cause for their problems. We also provide free to Londoners apps and online courses, such as Sleepio and Be Mindful, and if you follow their guidance, it really makes a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause people feel frustrated with themselves, self-help techniques often feel like the best way forward.

Carers for those in later life, those with disabilities, those with long term health conditions or cancer, and those with mental health problems. This is an unpaid army of unsung heroes, often selflessly losing sight of their own health and dreams, as they commit themselves to the care of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to research from the Carers Trust, there are 7 million carers in the UK, saving the economy £132 billion per year; a fact so powerful, it really should be on the side of a bus. 3 out of 5 of us will be carers at some point in our lives, and for many that will be in mid-life, though there are estimated to be at least 376,000 young adult carers in the UK aged 16–25. 47% of carers may be supporting someone for over 90 hours a week, and yet 38% of carers are in full or part-time work as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut despite the NHS depending upon carers for long term conditions, end of life care and for those with disabilities, many carers feel undervalued. According to the Carers UK’s “State of Caring Report 2018” a priority for carers was for the NHS “Recognise our contribution and value us.” It is of little surprise that the same report states that 71% of carers in the UK said they had suffered mental ill health as a result of caring. Further, 61% of carers in the UK said they had suffered physical ill health as a result of caring. The burden is great, the costs to the carer concerning, whilst the benefits to the economy and wider society significant. This is an area of marked inequality, which we at Good Thinking want to help with. But before sharing how we can and are starting to help, there is an aspect to caring that you may not have thought about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is widely known that doctors should not medically treat their families or anyone else that they have a close relationship with. This makes a lot of sense, and there have been tragedies when this guidance is overlooked. The American Medical Association states the reasons for this include “the doctor’s possible lack of professional objectivity, potential failure to probe sensitive topics or perform an intimate examination, and possible feeling of obligation to perform care for which he or she is unqualified.” Take a moment. Many of the reasons why doctors are not supposed to treat their families, we expect of carers to live with, and those they care for. Of course, this is usually because love, trust and forgiveness on both sides allows for the most difficult moments to borne with sensitivity; but this is a very complex process that should not be taken for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is hope that technology may help us more with some of the challenges, if not yet – advice on what do to, for example – and sometimes the opportunities ahead might surprise. At an event on using robots for care, a commonly held view was that being cared for by people was better. For older people that was only partly true; a robot helping you in the bathroom, maintained your dignity better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnology is already helping in many ways, even today. And for those isolated in their care of someone, being able to access support, and connect with other carers can lessen the loneliness. This is something we are hoping to develop further at Good Thinking, and are talking with Scope, the Alzheimer’s Society, Macmillan and even Money Savings Expert (the financial strain of being a carer is huge) to give our users a broad range of places where they can find support from people they relate to and identify with: ‘people like me’.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also have a self-assessment tool that can help you check how your mental health is, and soon, we hope at the end of that assessment you can get advice from and opportunities in your local community that could help. There is even a section for carers in the self-assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also know that carers need to prioritise their own self-care. We have tips to help with that, from trying to manage the anxieties and worries about your situation, to improving your mood through mindfulness, or just simple tips that may help improve sleep. But we need to do more, and we will be working hard to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a time of rapid global change and shifting values, it is important that we take time in Carers Week to learn something from those who are in many ways supporting us all, through their compassion and sacrifices. And if we can make time to do that, we may then want to create a world where we give something back to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJoin the conversation \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GoodThinkingUK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@goodthinkingUK\u003c/a\u003e on Twitter\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVisit \u003ca href=\"/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGood Thinking\u003c/a\u003e to explore tools and resources that can help you on your personal journey.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/about-good-thinking/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn more\u003c/a\u003e about Good Thinking \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the author\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr Richard Graham is a Consultant Child \u0026amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist, former Clinical Director of the Adolescent Directorate at the Tavistock Clinic and Clinical Lead for Good Thinking.

Looking back, I realise now how much pressure I was putting myself under. I don’t know if it is a male thing or a police thing or a combination of the two but I’d spent almost 30 years in policing and had fixed in my mind how the last few days of my service would play out – last day on patrol, handing back the uniform, cakes, handshakes and good wishes from my colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I worked through the winter months of 2018 the reality was that my mental health was failing. 30 years of exposure to trauma was taking its toll. Austerity had played its part. As a specialist family liaison officer supporting families of road death, fewer officers meant I was exposed to far more grief and trauma. Several of the cases I dealt with in those final years were children and young people, often multiple child fatalities. They were always the toughest ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was used to the challenges of shift work. I’d worked in uniform on various rolling shift patterns throughout my service. 6-7 hours of sleep would see me through. When the disturbed sleep came it wiped me out. I’d be able to fall asleep with few difficulties but 3 or 4 hours later I’d be awake. Thinking, mulling things over, questioning the things that I’d known and accepted to be true. Then came the intrusive images – particularly the children. The photos I’d requested from the bereaved families for release to the press, now came to mind – daily. The haunting image of a 2-year-old boy was the most frequent, killed on a road two miles from my home, a road that I travelled on frequently. I didn’t need the physical reminder, the image always seemed to be with me anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day when travelling to work I began to have what I now know were palpitations. My heart was racing, my throat was tight, I gripped the steering wheel, I began to sweat. More than that, and more worryingly for me, was the sense of dread of approaching my place of work. From that time on, it seemed like a cascade effect was in unstoppable flow. One racing thought triggered another – a domino fell. I’d have feelings of anger and rage – a domino fell. I had a deep sense of guilt for perceived organisational failings that I had no control over – another domino fell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen came the mind fog. The inability to do simple routine tasks. It was like someone had pressed the pause button on my thoughts and actions. How could I get something so wrong, something that I’ve done hundreds of times before?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d taught fellow colleagues on stress management and building resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow could this be happening to me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m a Christian.

The reality was the more that I thought about retirement the more anxious I became.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, I surrendered some of my pride and acknowledged that I needed help. Work assisted by varying my shifts so I didn’t work beyond 11pm – that helped with some of the sleep aspects. The Police Federation organised counselling and that really helped me deal with some of the trauma that I had been carrying for years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe doctor prescribed meds for the palpitations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven then my stubbornness hindered my recovery. I wouldn’t go sick (that finish line was my sole objective), so counselling took place in duty time. How dumb was that. Getting my head sorted out and then within the hour responding to the same calls that exposed me to more trauma. I declined anti-depressants, fearful that they would make me ‘someone I wasn’t’. Who was I trying to kid? That had already happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually I came to a place of realisation that if I was going to make it to retirement and have any quality of life in my post-police life, I had to surrender all my pride and get myself sorted out.

My peers would describe me as, a ‘hard-working and driven individual’ but the challenges I faced with my mental health made things difficult at key moments in my life. From about the age of 15; I used to be impulsive and confrontational. Often getting into fights with my peers, teachers and strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember becoming extremely stressed during my GCSEs. I am the youngest out of five brothers, so I’ve always felt like I drew the short straw. I made myself feel that everything was down to me. Therefore, I was always concerned I would not achieve the standards I had put upon myself. I became so stressed that I had suffered seizures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was also paranoid. I would walk past a group of people and I would convince myself that the group were watching me, talking about me or laughing at me. The worst part was the experience of my voices. I became more and more paranoid, stressed and I put unhealthy pressure on myself. My voices started to take control over my life and I no longer felt I had control of my own actions and thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t find any happiness, anywhere. I was using cannabis to self-medicate, thinking it could help me. I kept being told to challenge my voices, but my option became to take the easy way out. I told myself “If I end my life, I won’t have to deal with this any longer”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point, it was inevitable I was seen by a Doctor. I was referred to a child adolescent mental health service and my therapist saved my life. It was not clear to me in the moment. Until, I learnt with any hardship follows ease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe day, I attempted to take my life, I remember my brother in the room crying to me “if you want to hurt yourself, you’re going to have to hurt me first”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn that day, the police were forced to take me into custody for affray. Although it was very clear I was mentally unwell, they treated it as a crime before anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was also then; I would be admitted into a mental health. Arriving at the mental health hospital, I was always aware of what was happening. However, I was not aware what it would be like nor how long I would end up being there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI spent approximately two years in and out of hospital. I met individuals who I will never forget; they encouraged me to be stronger. The experience shaped my future, my ambition, and my goal in life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I am much stronger and wiser individual. While it was difficult adjusting to these changes, I found the drive I had lost throughout the worst part of my mental health. I became so willing to help the people in a similar situation who believe, there is no hope or inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI pride myself in being a mental health and digital health ambassador. Along with being, a lived experienced individual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I look back at those difficult times and I am glad I was put through those challenges. lot of my recovery came from the willingness to want to get better. I was tired of restricting myself and not do anything about the difficulty I was facing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone has their tribulations. I just had to be patient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, I lost many friends during the peak of my mental health. That only comes as part of the journey, and I quickly learnt there is no reward in complaining. I kept hopeful, reminding myself “It could be worse”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll our struggles are determined by our perspective. I am happy and proud; I am a superhero with a duty because “that person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, I do what I can, the best that I can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA message from us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’d like to thank Antonio for sharing his experience of anxiety with the Good Thinking community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood Thinking provides a range of resources to support your mental health, including free NHS-approved wellbeing apps, expert advice and podcasts.

As research by Mind[1] shows, this has been intensified for people with a pre-existing mental health issue.

Something that has been essential for me during the isolation of the past year has been remaining connected to other trans people who understand and respect my experiences. I've done this by participating in and volunteering for (online) groups with local and national LGBTQ+ organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the worst parts of being trans is being part of a misunderstood minority that is so often discriminated against. Knowing that I have people I can relate to and talk about this with, whether online or in-person, has made a huge difference to my own mental health, especially during lockdown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we’ve learnt from recent events in the UK, even LGB people are not always supportive of trans rights, and sometimes even other trans people are not supportive of all trans/non-binary people, let alone wider society. Finding people that truly understand our experiences and support us is so essential to feeling connected to the world in a positive way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis leads me on to the idea that mental health is not always an individual problem and is very much tied together (for me at least) with national and international events, especially regarding trans issues. I’m not going to write about going on walks or meditating or spending less time on social media; I know these things can help many people significantly, but I’m sure these suggestions will be more adequately covered by others. Also, I see these things as treating symptoms of mental ill health rather than treating the causes, which is still worthwhile, but perhaps more of a short-term-fix than some people might like them to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiving in a country that still denies so many rights to trans people has a massive impact on my own and, I’m sure, others’ mental health, especially when our safety and respect is so often devalued. Our lives and experiences are almost constantly being discussed in the public sphere, many times without trans people being present and too often with incredible amounts of negativity, which has a regular negative impact on my mental health. This isn’t helped by the strain the NHS has been under this last year due to COVID-19 and current backlash against trans healthcare, making it even harder for trans people to receive the support they need, whether for mental health or gender-related purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething that has definitely helped keep me afloat emotionally over the last year has been getting involved with organisations that are aware of these issues and are working towards plugging the gaps that COVID-19 has exacerbated. Not everyone may have the capacity to be active in tackling these wider issues but, if you can (and this can take many forms), I would highly recommend getting in touch with a local or national group. You will meet like-minded people, build community and help tackle some of the underlying causes of mental ill health for some of the worst affected people in our society, hopefully leading to better mental health and wellbeing for everyone in the long run, not just in the short term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing connected to people and knowing I’m contributing to important causes that are tackling wider issues, even in a small way, really helps me keep going during this time and I would 100% recommend it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA message from us\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"\u003eWe’d like to thank Jodi for sharing their experiences with the Good Thinking community.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood Thinking provides a range of resources to support your mental health, including NHS-approved wellbeing apps, expert advice, podcasts and videos.
