If you’re being bullied, it might be hard to understand that it’s not actually about you but about the bully’s own insecurities.

Small things can make a big difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three tips that I have (from experience) found effective in bullying situations.</p><p><br></p><h3>1. Ignore and redirect where possible</h3><p>Standing up to bullying can simply be ignoring or diverting rude comments made to someone online or in person – it’s not about putting yourself in the spotlight. Typically, bullies are fuelled by attention from their peers (e.g. in the form of laughter) so not engaging with the bully is a big step. You can also try to redirect the conversation into something else to avoid rude exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Don’t create an audience for the bully&nbsp;</h3><p>Attention is what encourages bullying behaviour. It also intimidates the victim, which worsens the situation. So, try to avoid being part of the crowd during bullying incidents.&nbsp;Sometimes it can be difficult to walk away but, by doing this, you might get others to follow. There is strength in numbers.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Console the person being bullied in private</h3><p>Let them know that you do not agree with what is happening and advise them who they should talk to if they need help. Even making the victim feel as if their feelings are acknowledged and seen by their peers could be the boost they need.</p>"},{"id":"597","title":"Know your worth","content":"<p><em>By Rhea&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>&nbsp;\"Hurt people hurt people\", as Maxine Sinda Napal wisely pointed out. Bullies often lash out due to their own issues and it's crucial to understand that their behaviour is not a reflection of your worth. If you're experiencing bullying, know that you're not alone – countless others have confronted similar challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Bullying, which is defined as unwanted, aggressive behaviour with a power imbalance, can leave you feeling isolated. If you feel like you can relate to this definition, here are some practical tips to help you deal with bullying.</p><p><br></p><h3>1. Self-reflection</h3><p>Understand that bullying is not your fault. It does not define you or your character. Stay calm and remind yourself of your own self-worth.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Support</h3><p>Reach out to someone you trust and feel comfortable confiding in. This might be an older family member or a member of staff at school. Or you might even consider contacting a helpline or using a support service, such as <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Thinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nationalbullyinghelpline.co.uk/contact.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Bullying Helpline (0300 323 0169)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.themix.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Mix (0808 808 4994)</a>.</p><h3>3. Self-care</h3><p>Coping with bullying can be emotionally draining. Engage in self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This may include watching a movie, reading a book, knitting, dancing, or simply taking a walk. Prioritise yourself and your happiness.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Always remember, it will get better. You're not alone and you're worthy of help.

One of my favourite aspects of being a DHA so far is the feeling of acceptance there is of others’ opinions in the genuine motivation organisations have to develop and listen in order to help others.\"</li></ul>","columnWidth":"full"}]},{"__typename":"Blog","title":"My experience as an autistic student at university","slug":"experience-as-an-autistic-university-student","subtitle":"In this guest blog, recent London South Bank University (LSBU) graduate Michael draws on his own experience to provide advice for other students with autism.","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T18:58:40.711Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-26T06:28:35.960Z","metadata":{"id":"765","description":"This blog was written by LSBU graduate, Michael Arhin Acquaah and provides advice for other students with autism.","title":"My experience as an autistic student at university","image":{"data":null}},"author":{"id":"34","name":"Michael Arhin Acquaah","title":"London South Bank University Graduate","headshot":{"data":{"id":"503","attributes":{"alternativeText":"Headshot of Michael Arhin-Acquaah, LSBU third year student","width":1324,"height":1357,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a.jpg","size":141.03,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/large_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a.jpg","hash":"large_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"large_LSBU_Michael_headshot cropped.jpg","path":null,"size":83.58,"width":976,"height":1000},"small":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/small_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a.jpg","hash":"small_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"small_LSBU_Michael_headshot cropped.jpg","path":null,"size":25.35,"width":488,"height":500},"medium":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a.jpg","hash":"medium_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"medium_LSBU_Michael_headshot cropped.jpg","path":null,"size":50.73,"width":732,"height":750},"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_LSBU_Michael_headshot cropped.jpg","path":null,"size":4.26,"width":152,"height":156}},"hash":"LSBU_Michael_headshot_cropped_34f8b5086a","name":"LSBU_Michael_headshot.jpg","provider":"aws-s3"}}},"socials":[]},"contentSections":[{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"571","content":"<p>While completing my final piece of coursework for a BSc in Psychology, I began to reflect on my experience as an autistic university student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Locating advice, support and reliable signposting services was sporadic and difficult.

It’s a big turning point and you have to make a lot of important decisions. Some of my peers struggled to find explicit definitions of key terms relevant to the application process. The <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/ucas-terms-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website outlines these but I’ll also explain each term I use in this blog.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal statement </strong></p><p>One of the things you need to include in your university application is a ‘personal statement’. This is a summary (up to 4000 characters) in which you explain why you’re applying for your chosen course and highlight your unique experiences and passions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When writing your personal statement, it’s good to map out application deadlines so you complete everything on time. If you struggle with unfamiliar tasks, you might like to ask a teacher or friend to support you with the application process.</p><p>The ‘Applying to university’ section on the <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-to-university\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website is very useful. It includes advice about when to apply, how to fill in your application and how to obtain references. The <a href=\"https://www.studential.com/personal-statement-examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Studiential</a> website offers course-specific personal statement examples but be careful of plagiarism – you want your personal statement to be your own.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Open days</strong></p><p>I also recommend attending the open days at your chosen universities as tours of the campus and accommodation can help you familiarise yourself with the new environment. Virtual tours have a similar effect and are good if you live far away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During Sixth Form, I found it really helpful to attend taster lectures relevant to Psychology as it gave me an idea of what university learning would look and feel like. Lecture theatres are a lot bigger than your average classroom and I personally prefer to sit in the back corner so I can see everything that’s going on. I even practised taking notes to get an idea of the kind of resources I might need to support me during my classes.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"575","title":"Getting prepared","content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UCAS</a> website offers general guidance about university life but I find that other autistic people’s experiences (on personal blogs like this one and in YouTube videos) are really valuable. If you can’t find what you need, try asking other autistic students who you know or post a comment or question on <a href=\"https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Student Room</a> website.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Student finance</strong></p><p>One of the most important things to sort out early on is how you’ll finance your studies and living costs. You might need to complete a student finance application, which provides you with a student loan for your tuition fees that is paid directly to your university. Someone else can apply for this on your behalf but you would need to give permission for them to do this. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to support your living costs while you are studying. This is dependent on your household income but students on a low income or those who are care leavers might receive additional financial support. Extra funding might also be available for students on specific courses.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to reapply for student finance every year. I tended to do this in late Spring because it helped me get an idea of my budget and meant that I wasn’t worried about my loans dropping late. You can find out more about applying for student finance on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/student-finance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UK Government</a> website.</p><p>When setting up your student finance, you’ll be given the option to apply for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)</a>. This funding is for people with a mental health problem, long-term illness or disability so you’ll need to provide your autism diagnosis or proof of long-term disability. Unlike the student loan, this allowance doesn’t need to be paid back. My DSA funded frequent support outside of the support I received from my university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to take to class</strong></p><p>Knowing what you need for your classes depends on the course you’re taking but it’s typically a good idea to bring:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A notebook for each module so you can keep your notes separate&nbsp;</li><li>A planner, if you use one&nbsp;</li><li>A pencil case (I reckon an exam-style pencil case is easier than lugging all of your stationery around but I’m guilty of doing both!)&nbsp;</li><li>Any reading or writing aids you use (e.g. coloured overlays, glasses, laptops or tablets)&nbsp;</li><li>A water bottle&nbsp;</li><li>Lunch or a snack if you’re going to be out all day&nbsp;</li><li>Any medication you’ll need to take</li><li>A backpack that fits everything in it (a laptop compartment is GREAT if you’ll be bringing a device with you)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As part of of the support I received from my university, I was given a laptop with dictation and mind map software on it, a portable charger, noise cancelling headphones and a printer to scan and print my essay plans and coursework briefs!</p><p><strong>Learning styles</strong></p><p>Watching ‘day in the life’ YouTube videos of people on similar courses can be helpful as you might find some people with similar learning styles to you.&nbsp;</p><p>I struggled to organise tasks and deadlines so I bought a planner, some 'to do’ lists, and a handful of notebooks for all my rough thoughts. Breaking large tasks down into&nbsp;smaller steps made them a lot less overwhelming to tackle. Conversely, it sometimes made it difficult to get started!&nbsp;</p><p>To combat this, I did a lot of body doubling with my friends who lived nearby. This is a productivity technique where you and someone else sit together and each work through your own tasks. Body doubling even works quite well over the phone!</p>"},{"id":"577","title":"Starting university ","content":"<p>Your university’s website will contain information about how to apply for hardship funds and bursaries but it can also signpost you to other support services.</p><p><strong>Getting the right support</strong></p><p>Most universities offer a wellbeing service and a disability support service. You can call or email to let them know in advance that you require some reasonable adjustments to access your course. They’ll likely have a form for you to fill in or will invite you to a meeting to discuss what you need. You should also let the accommodation team know to ensure that additional support is available for you off campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good to do this sooner rather than later. I had all my support set up the moment I knew which university I would be going to, which meant everything was in place for when I started that Autumn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some universities offer screenings for specific learning difficulties (SpLDs), such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. This varies uni to uni with some even offering autism assessments for those who are undiagnosed so it’s good to check the university website to see what is available. One of these screenings picked up that I had ADHD and later resulted in me being identified as autistic. Getting a diagnosis can help you access the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)</a>.</p><p>Although I am more than my labels, learning more about ADHD and autism meant I could address how my study habits and available support were failing to acknowledge how I think and learn differently. I was always aware I was autistic as many of my siblings are but the diagnosis was surprisingly clarifying and affirming for me. Prior to this, my autism was disregarded throughout my education and I was relieved to know that it wasn’t just the “me problem” that everyone had lead me to believe. I now relate so much more to many old and new autistic friends who understand my communication and sensory needs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Connecting with others</strong></p><p>At LSBU, my Autism Specialist Mentor helped me structure my course deadlines and work at a pace that was viable and appropriate for me, ensuring I didn’t get burnt out. She also liaised with my university disability team and my Personal Tutor on my behalf when I could not. I also had a Study Skills tutor who helped me structure my essay plans and who would routinely check on my progress to make sure I was staying on track.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good to communicate with your personal tutor, lecturers and seminar leaders about what you may need support with. Never be afraid to ask the questions that you need to ask! If they can’t help you with something, they’ll let you know or they’ll direct you to people who can. Better to be safe than sorry. You might need to follow up with these communications, as the inboxes can be swamped. I found it difficult to remember to do this so I’d set reminders on my phone and write it on my daily task lists. Some email accounts will also prompt you to follow up an email that has yet to receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Making new friends</strong></p><p>Socialising and making new friends at university isn’t easy for every autistic person. I put a note introducing myself on the door of my accommodation, which made meeting my flatmates less nerve-wracking. I also recommend finding clubs and societies that cater to your interests as you’ll likely find a lot of likeminded people there. If you don’t find one that you’d like to join, why not start your own?&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"576","title":"Living independently","content":"<p>You might be expected to do a lot of things independently once you’re living in student accommodation so it’s useful to familiarise yourself with these things before you move in. Some independent living tasks may not come naturally to you and that’s okay! We all learn things at different times and at different speeds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to pack</strong></p><p>Student accommodation can be unpredictable and it can be hard to know what to take with you.

Try to have to enough of your medication and prescriptions to last until you register with a GP or pharmacy closer to uni, especially if you find these things difficult to sort out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cooking and cleaning</strong></p><p>I saved a bunch of recipe websites and videos to give me some ideas on what I could cook for myself. Practising these recipes was key but it took some getting used to the stove at my accommodation as it was different to what I had at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Some student accommodation offers partial catering and will provide breakfast and lunch either as part of your rent or for an additional fee. Some will clean common areas in your flat or even your room! Nevertheless, it’s good to know how to clean up after yourself as it could prevent any accidental damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.unihomes.co.uk/blog/how-to-deep-clean-your-student-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unihomes blog</a><strong><em> </em></strong>offers cleaning advice for students and a list of cleaning products that are worth purchasing. There are also lots of helpful videos online – cleaning videos on TikTok provided me with some visual examples for tasks I found difficult to picture in my head.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend uses a cleaning app called <a href=\"https://sweepy.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sweepy</a> to help with their problems with object permanence. It lets you know how clean everything is and can help you stay on track of cleaning tasks by sending notifications to your phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Budgeting</strong></p><p>Working out how much money you need for rent, food, travel, laundry and any other recurring expenses is a good way to live within your means.</p><p>I recommend setting a budget for your weekly or monthly shops so that you don’t spend more than you can afford. I wrote a shopping list every week and kept a list on my phone of things that needed to be replaced. It’s easy to find apps that can help you with this (e.g. figuring out recipes based on what you have in the house or keeping track of when certain food items are due to expire). Try to limit the number of ready meals you buy as it’s cheaper to make food yourself but I did find they came in handy when I was working to tight deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Remember to consider the sources of income you have, such as your student loans, DSA or any jobs you are working. If you’re struggling, find out whether your university offers a hardship fund or bursary.</p>"}]},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"585","content":"<h3>Message of encouragement</h3><p>I will never regret pursuing an undergraduate degree as an autistic person.

Being a musician has led me onto unexpected paths. My work now includes being a music mentor and facilitator for various music and mental health programmes. I have run music sessions in mental health units and worked on the wellbeing team for Girls Rock London.&nbsp;</p><p>Being queer with not much family contact or support during this pandemic has been a challenge. I've continued to work towards healthier life choices but it's been tough. Living in isolation reminded me how important being part of an LGBTQ+ community is for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I’m still healing from all those years I suppressed my sexuality”</strong></p><p>When you lack compassion and consistency in an important area of your life, you search for it in other places. I recently attended an online funding support session for LGBTQ+ creatives and saw an abundance of pronouns light up my computer screen. I felt at home. I realised how much I missed not being able to attend queer spaces in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first came out, I was led to believe that my sexual identity wouldn't always feel so impactful and would eventually settle. Yet fast forward to now and it's become bigger for me.&nbsp;</p><p>In lockdown, I learnt that I'm still healing from all those years I suppressed my sexuality. I craved understanding and acceptance from the environment I grew up in but I realised that people can only truly comprehend if they put time, heart and energy into educating themselves on what it means to be LGBTQ+.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of my anxiety and mental health difficulties stems from suppressing my voice and truth. I was in primary school during the 80s and Section 28 played a harmful part in stunting my personal development and growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I wanted to move forward with my life”</strong></p><p>During the first lockdown, I had been doing counselling once a week. Counselling can be intense. Doing this in isolation without being able to gig or meet up with friends heightened that intensity. Although having this therapy was necessary for me at the time, I got to a point where I needed to change the route. I didn't want to feel angry any more. I wanted to move forward with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I had originally accessed the services of a holistic lesbian and gay centre 10 years ago. Based in East London, it offers a whole range of social, emotional and support services to LGBT+ communities. As I follow the centre on Twitter, I came across one of its opportunities. It was offering six free sessions to help people with their triggers, creating a self help toolkit. This was exactly what I needed and, after a few disappointing scenarios with counsellors, I longed to feel anchored again. I’d known the centre for a while so I trusted I'd be in safe hands.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I’d be given a fresh outlook and actions to take”</strong></p><p>I was assigned a wonderful mental health worker who created a wellbeing roadmap for me. These 1-2-1 sessions offered me a range of tools and activities. We looked at The Drama Triangle, which helped me to further understand patterns and behaviours. This helped me to gain more clarity which then gave me confidence to make alternative choices for myself. I was given grounding techniques, coping mechanisms, and even homework!&nbsp;</p><p>For one week I had to go away and write down all the things in my life that I found difficult; the people and situations that ignited my anxiety and low moods. We’d then talk through what I’d written in our next 1-2-1 and I’d be given a fresh outlook and actions to take. Another week, we looked at safe spaces and I was asked to create a list of people who I feel comfortable to go to when I need that extra support. I learnt a little about body-based therapies. I’ve done kinesiology before and if I were to revisit counselling in the future, I would definitely wish to explore body psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p>In counselling, I was often working through and bringing up a lot of past trauma. This, of course, is important for many reasons. But I got stuck. Moving away from this particular talking therapy and entering a new chapter was necessary and offered me the support and space that I needed to feel better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Receiving help from an LGBTQ+ organisation brought me extra comfort”</strong></p><p>Now, if I experience a challenging moment or situation, I know who to contact and I recognise my safe spaces that help me to feel grounded. I know to be kinder to myself and my body when I’m feeling vulnerable or distressed. For me this is invaluable and empowering.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn’t have known where to start with any of this if not for the support of the people at the centre. It can be easy to doubt oneself when treading a new pathway so having someone who genuinely cares and who is offering you guidance and assurance does wonders. Since these sessions, I have started to feel lighter and a sense of relief. It's been rocky at times but I feel more self-assured in the direction I’m taking.&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying our needs and the type of support that is right for us is key. Receiving help from an LGBTQ+ organisation brought me the extra comfort and safety that I needed in order to keep growing and learning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A message from us</strong></p><p>Just as MIRI sought support from a specialist organisation, there are lots of other LGBTQ+ counselling services across London available to support you.

While writing this blog, I’m also in the process of finishing up my final pieces of coursework for my degree! The lovely people at Good Thinking have invited me to write about my experience of beginning university in London three years ago as an 18-year-old Black Queer student.</p><h3>Settling into university life and meeting new people</h3><p>Starting university was really nerve-wracking at first, particularly because I am also autistic. It’s an unfamiliar environment and I wasn’t&nbsp;doing the same courses as my friends from sixth form. I chose to stay in university accommodation so I let the accommodation know that I was trans and kept in very good communication with their wellbeing facilities. This was to ensure I’d be one of the lucky ones who got an en suite room as I find shared facilities quite daunting and am more comfortable with my own spaces. I wanted to be stealth for a bit so I could focus on my studies rather than being preoccupied with any outcomes or reactions that I found worrisome!&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first things I did when I moved in was leave a note introducing myself on the door. When I met my flatmates, I was quickly identified as “the one with the note on the door” – everyone found me really approachable after that. I struggle with small talk and can sometimes feel anxious when meeting new people so this took the edge off introducing myself.</p><p>I found transitioning from school to university classes particularly difficult because we were still learning remotely and social distancing due to COVID and it remained this way until my second year. This also made it difficult to meet new people and see old friends. Although my childhood friend, Alfred, went to LSBU as well, I could still feel&nbsp;isolated. He stayed in a different accommodation and was on a different course so we couldn’t really relate to each other’s specific experiences.</p><p>Starting university can cause a lot of your existing friendship circles to shift, especially if your friends have also gone to university. Hanging out when you’ve got to manage a new workload will look a lot different from what you are used to. I didn’t get to see my old circle of academically-ambitious friends as often after they scattered themselves across the UK. All of a sudden, the community I had been so well supported by felt harder to reach and I worried that I would struggle to find people I could so closely identify with on campus. This ended up not being that much of an issue – after COVID, we were all quite accustomed to video calls and digital hangouts. When meet ups became few and far between, I was always reassured by the fact that my loved ones were but a phone call away.</p><h3>Finding your community&nbsp;</h3><p>It’s important to feel like you belong in your immediate environment – on your course, in your accommodation and in societies and clubs that you may join. This can be difficult when you’re both Black and Queer. I found that some Black spaces were not always the most queer-inclusive and that Queer spaces were considerably less diverse than I would have hoped.</p><p>This shouldn’t make you want to close yourself off though! Even if few and far between, I did find a few diamonds in the rough who helped me through my degree.</p><p>Before moving in, I researched all the clubs, activities and societies available for Black and/or Queer students, both on and off campus. Echoing other blog posts you may have read on the Good Thinking website, connecting with other Black LGBT+ students was really validating for me, especially because I wasn’t very vocal about my trans identity outside of these friendships until I started my third year (most of my university friends will likely only find out once they see this blog post!).</p><p>I participated in plenty of projects focusing on enhancing the university experiences of Black and Queer students, providing insight on how to best maximise inclusivity so that the next generation of undergraduates will receive a warm welcome and plenty of adequate support. In fact, my participation in the <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students/LSBU-black-students-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Black Students Mental Health Project</a> provided me with quite a few opportunities relevant to my degree and helped me feel like my input would have an impact on how certain decisions would be made.</p><p>Like many university gyms, mine was part of a scheme that provides the opportunity to attend the gyms at other participating universities across the country. This allowed me to go to the gym with my pre-university mates and we all know how instrumental both exercise and community are for your wellbeing!</p><p>As my university also had a campus in Croydon, I was lucky to become acquainted with <a href=\"http://croydondropin.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Croydon Drop In</a>, which is a counselling service that offers advice, advocacy and signposting to further support.</p><p>I also attended London Pride events, which are a marvellously massive display of pride in our identities, demonstrating the very large and intersectional community we have built in this city. Some universities march in the parade so it is always worth looking into.</p><h3>Getting support from your university</h3><p>I communicated with the wellbeing and disability staff and services at my university the second I confirmed my choices. This meant that they were well-prepared to provide me with my exact support arrangements for ADHD and ASD when I began my classes. I had pretty poor experiences regarding my identity in school so I wanted to make sure I would be well-supported if I had any negative experiences that could impact my studies.</p><p>Universities can often provide counselling, Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD) assessments and signposting to other useful forms of support you might not be aware of, so it’s really good to be open and honest about anything you may be going through. Keeping in good communication will also help with any coursework extensions, disability accommodations or extenuating circumstances you may need throughout your degree.</p><h3>Becoming part of London’s trans community</h3><p>For any trans readers, I just want you to know that the London trans community is very tight-knit and communicative. We are all well aware of the negativity directed towards us in the media but you will be well looked after by all of us here! There will always be a friend, somewhere, and we are infamously known for how much we all know each other.</p><p>Groups such as <a href=\"https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mermaids</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mosaictrust.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mosaic</a> and <a href=\"https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gendered Intelligence</a> are good people to turn to and we have healthcare services, such as <a href=\"https://www.dean.st/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56 Dean Street</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wearetransplus.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TransPlus</a>, who make experiences such as sexual health screenings and gender identity support very positive and stress-free.</p><p>Be sure to attend Trans Pride as well!</p><h3>Useful resources for Black Queer students</h3><p>Here is a list of organisations for Black Queer students recommended by students at LSBU:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://blkoutuk.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BLKOUT UK </a>was created to recognise the need for Black Queer men to have a space to think, shout, show off, celebrate, launch, reflect, share and be heard. It encourages and stimulates debate and discussion online and face to face through its website, writer workshops, networking events and supporting interventions to meet the needs of Black Queer men.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.houseofrainbow.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">House of Rainbow</a> fosters relationships among LGBTIQ+ people of colour, people of faith and allies to create a safer and a more inclusive community. With active groups in London and Africa, it is able to assist with issues and challenges such as reconciling sexuality and spirituality, asylum seekers’ support, sexual health, mental health and hate crimes.</li><li><a href=\"https://purpleraincollective.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Purple Rain Collective</a> is a collective for Queer, Trans and Intersex people of colour (QTIPOC) in the UK to mobilise, converse on their experiences and develop strategies for safety, resistance, and liberation. It creates a space where the QTIPOC community is choosing to come together and be there for one another in ways that prioritise their care, safety and wellbeing.</li></ul><h3><strong>Useful Good Thinking resources</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental health and wellbeing support for students</a> - check out Good Thinking’s range of advice and support to help you to stay mentally healthy at college and university</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students/LSBU-black-students-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental health and wellbeing support created by and for black students</a> - explore the full range of blogs, podcasts and videos created by the LSBU Black Students Mental Health Project</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/advice/exam-stress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stressed about exams?</a> - advice to students on how to stay mentally well during exam season</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/five-ways-good-mental-wellbeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Five ways to good mental wellbeing</a> - five steps you can take to help you to start to feel more positive and boost your wellbeing</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/how-guides/quick-guides-support-others\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Looking out for those around you</a> – a series of guides to help support friends and others in your community who may be struggling with their mental health</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/self-assessments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Self-assessments</a> – a clinically-validated mental health self-assessment that provides you with a guiding diagnosis, helpful resources and, if necessary, relevant treatment advice</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/student-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Student Health App</a> – a free app that enables you to instantly access reliable, relevant and reassuring health and wellbeing information</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/international-student\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">International Student App</a> – a free app for international students in the UK that contains information and tips to help you to settle into university life</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/free-apps-for\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Other free NHS-approved apps</a> - check out the full range of apps that Good Thinking recommend to help boost your mental wellbeing</li></ul>","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsLinkBanner"}]},{"__typename":"Blog","title":"How to use journaling to boost your mental health","slug":"how-to-use-journaling-to-boost-your-mental-health","subtitle":"Looking for a simple way to process your emotions?

For example, if you feel anxious, depressed or stressed but you’re not ready to talk to other people about it, it can help you develop a better relationship with yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog, the Good Thinking team provides some tips if you’re new to journaling and Tamikah, a postgraduate student at LSBU, shares how her own journaling habit is an important part of her self-care routine.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is journaling?</h3><p>Journaling is where you make a note of things that have happened and how you’re feeling, either in writing or as an audio recording. You might like to think of your journal as a check-in tool and a safe space for you to arrange your thoughts and process your emotions.</p><h3>How can journaling support good mental health?</h3><p>Studies show that journaling can help you to manage anxiety, stress and depression. It can also help you to be more focused, understand yourself better and appreciate the little things in life.</p><h3>Tips to get started with journaling</h3><ul><li>Decide how you’ll keep your journal – you could use your laptop, download a journaling app, write by hand in a notebook or make voice memos on your phone.</li><li>Start small – set a timer and write in your journal for one or two minutes every couple of days then build up to longer.</li><li>Be honest and open – this is your journal so there’s no need to censor any feelings, thoughts or fears.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/advice/use-disruption-your-routine-develop-new-healthy-habit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Make it a habit</a> – try to journal at the same time every day (you might like to combine it with another part of your daily routine, such as getting ready for bed or drinking your morning coffee).</li><li>Use prompts – if the blank page is intimidating, you could draw two columns a) what went well today? and b) what didn’t go well today? and write how they made you feel.</li><li>Stick with your journaling – some days (e.g. when you’re tired or stressed), you might not feel like doing it but it’s those times when it will be even more helpful.</li><li>Enjoy the process – find a quiet place and listen to some relaxing music while you’re writing in your journal.</li><li>Track your mood over time – as well as referring back to your journal entries, you could use the free <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/my-possible-self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">My Possible Self app</a> to highlight activities, places and people that influence your mood so you can focus on the things that make you feel great and do less of the things that don’t.</li></ul><h3>Tamikah's experience of journaling</h3><p>“One of the main ways I take care of my mental health is through journaling but it's a little unconventional.</p><p>For a whole year, I journaled using pen and paper but I absolutely hated it because it was so much effort and work and I felt like I wasn't getting all of the words in my head down on paper.</p><p>So, what I do now – and it works well for me – is I use the voice memo app on my phone to kind of journal out loud to myself. Basically, I hold my phone and I have a conversation with myself and that's my version of journaling.&nbsp;</p><p>I found that I can do it multiple times a day – it can be short or long; it depends how I’m feeling. I just try to make sure that I put something in there at least once a week and the key here is being consistent. I usually do it at the end of my day and it helps relax me before I go to sleep.</p><p>I always try to make sure that I’m adding in the positives from my life because I feel like journalists get so caught up in writing down the negatives or something really bad that happened to them that sometimes you can forget to put in the positives that have happened that week or that day.&nbsp;</p><p>My advice to other people would be to find a way of journaling that works for you. I was advised to start with pen and paper and it did help me but it wasn’t something I could commit to long term. Once I figured out the voice memo journaling on my phone, it was something that I knew I could keep up with. I enjoy it. It’s kind of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Journaling is something that anyone of any age can do because we all have mobile phones or some sort of personal device like a tablet or laptop.

I want to talk about how stressful it is loving someone with an alcohol dependency.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard for me to put into context just how frustrating and anxiety fuelling it is watching someone you love being sucked into the depths of addiction. I liken it to watching someone you love drown and you’re powerless to do anything about it but watch until the inevitable happens.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent my entire teens and early adult life right up until my dad’s inevitable death from alcohol use disorder worrying about him every day. I worried so much about him that I developed anxiety. I worried so much that it became my normal and I forgot what a stress-free life felt like.&nbsp;</p><p>You see I loved my dad so much and I was determined to “fix” him, I wanted to help him, and I so desperately wanted control of the situation. But the reality of this situation is that I had as much control as he did. Which was zero.&nbsp;</p><p>My stress levels ended abruptly when we switched off his life support machine following an excessive alcohol binge. When my dad succumbed to his addiction, I felt relief. I was relieved that he was no longer suffering, and I was relieved that I no longer had to live with the constant worry and stress about my dad’s unpredictable addiction.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the relief, it wasn’t quite that simple, because with relief came a gut-punching and overwhelming sense of guilt. I genuinely believed that I killed him, and I felt awful for feeling relieved.</p><p>I lived a stressful life when my dad was alive, and I never knew how to manage it. The stigma attached to addiction and mental health caused me to keep a family secret, and the stigma attached to talking about our stresses caused my dad to drink. My dad struggled with his mental health but was too embarrassed to ask for help, so instead he chose to drown out the noise with alcohol. We practiced this outward-facing facade that everything was “perfect” and I was consumed with worrying about what others would think of my dad and us as a family.</p><p>This is why when we did lose my dad I decided to never hide my stresses again. I realised that brushing our stresses under the carpet with alcohol and pretending everything was fine was actually toxic for us. I now talk openly and embrace my mental health and this has aided my own recovery. I realised that we weren’t alone and that millions of others share similar stories to ours. I am now unapologetically honest about my experiences and discuss my stresses with no shame, I manage them in a healthy way, and I accept that there will always be elements of stress in my life.</p><p>I have now committed to advocating against the stigma attached to mental health and addiction, and I am determined to ensure that my dad’s death can become a catalyst for positive change.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A note from Good Thinking</strong></h2><p>Sarah’s experiences growing up with stress as part of her everyday life and struggling with the stigma around talking about alcohol addiction and mental health have shaped her mission to de-stigmatise alcohol addiction.</p><p>Sarah is a passionate mental health advocate and founder of WarriorKind CIC, a not-for-profit mental health support network devoted to advocating positive conversations around mental health and committed to quashing the stigma attached to mental illness experiences.</p><p><a href=\"https://warriorkind.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about Warriorkind</a>.</p><h2><strong>Need help starting those difficult conversations?</strong></h2><p>Opening up a conversation about mental health can feel difficult for a number of reasons; many people are uncomfortable talking about their feelings, and mental health issues are often stigmatised so people are worried that they may be judged for talking about their concerns.

My role in the team is focused on engaging with communities in London to collectively improve the mental health and wellbeing of all Londoners. I regularly meet residents at events across London to raise awareness of the great NHS-approved resources that Good Thinking offers all Londoners, free of charge.</p><p>I’m currently observing Ramadan and want to share a little about my experience of how taking time for spiritual reflection can benefit mental wellbeing. Ramadan marks the 9<sup>th</sup> month in the Islamic calendar and is a month of fasting from dawn to sunset for Muslims worldwide. The end of Ramadan is marked by Eid al-Fitr, a day for all Muslims to unite and celebrate by dressing up, visiting family and friends and, most importantly, eating great food!</p><h3>A time for spiritual reflection</h3><p>For many Muslims, such as myself, it is a time to reflect and reconnect with our faith. We do this through prayer, increasing our charitable activities and engaging with our local community.</p><p>I, along with many other Muslims, chose to reduce the time spent on social media, watching TV and reading the news. We do this because Ramadan is a time when we enjoy focusing on reconnection with our faith and genuinely taking the time to treasure what the month can help us achieve. I have found Ramadan to be especially healing to my physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p><h3>Kindness and empathy</h3><p>One of the most important lessons of Ramadan is to be kind and empathetic toward one another. We are reminded of the less fortunate people around the world and our very own communities living in poverty and suffering from great hardships.</p><p>In remembrance of those less fortunate, it is commonplace for Muslims to increase our charitable donations and support as a way of giving back to those most in need.</p><p>But please also remember that you can give back to those less fortunate in other ways. There may be people within your very own circle that need support.</p><h3>Look out for loved ones and those in your local community</h3><p>The month of Ramadan is the perfect opportunity to check in on those around you and see how you can support them in improving their mental health and wellbeing, particularly if they find fasting tough.

My MSc thesis, ‘A thematic analysis of interviews with young black men on perspectives of barriers to help-seeking behaviours in the United Kingdom,’ identified and examined three themes that illustrate how the lack of ethnic representation in mental health services is a barrier to help-seeking behaviours of young black men:</p><ul><li>gaps and facilitations in knowledge and accessibility of mental health services;</li><li>the difficulties of navigating hereditary cultures and adopted social pressures;</li><li>the challenges of responding to discrimination and mental health stigma.</li></ul><p>My academic research and interests led me directly into my current role as Project Officer for the <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Office for Students (OfS)</a> at <a href=\"https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LSBU</a> where I lead on the <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students/LSBU-Black-students-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Black Students Mental Health Project (BSMHP)</a>. Over the last few years, I’ve been proud to be involved in a number of amazing projects that benefit the students and black community here at LSBU, like joining the <a href=\"https://www.unitegroup.com/living-black-at-university\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unite Students Commission on Living Black at University</a> as a commissioner providing mental health and wellbeing expertise, and hosting a wellbeing stage at <a href=\"https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UK Black Pride</a> where I took part in a panel to discuss the intersectional work being done to support LGBTQ+ persons of colour in higher education and how LSBU is contributing.&nbsp;The BSMHP has also worked with closely with LBSU student services. We listened to student feedback on the language and imagery used to advertise the service and made changes which have facilitated a better understanding among students.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why did the Black Students Mental Health Project (BSMHP) start up?</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/mental-health-are-all-students-being-properly-supported/#student\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National data</a> indicates that black students are significantly disadvantaged in terms of outcomes in higher education and this disadvantage further impacts those black students with a mental health diagnosis. The BSMHP aims to initiate institutional change and was set up to promote early access to mental health support services and good mental wellbeing practices and to prevent mental health deterioration in the black community.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2021 academic year, the proportion of black LSBU students seen by university mental health services was level with the student population (25%). However, we found that black students were less likely to self-refer for support and were overrepresented within the university’s crisis referral pathways, including fitness to study.</p><h3>Mind the gap</h3><p>LSBU data indicated several contributing factors to the widening gap between mental health service awareness and service use by LSBU black students. Research within the first year of the project gave insights into the challenges that black students face, which suggested that:</p><ul><li>Students experience a lack of representation and culturally competent service with culturally relevant resources.</li><li>There is a sense of isolation amongst black students and stigma around mental health and seeking help.&nbsp;</li><li>Academic staff do not significantly contribute to students’ mental health and their wellbeing support journey.&nbsp;</li><li>There is a lack of awareness of the support services available.</li></ul><p>The challenge was to find ways to make services become and feel more inclusive and to help change the narrative around mental health difficulties and attitudes to seeking help within the black community.</p><h3>Bridging the gap</h3><p>Student voice has directed the project from the start. Our research showed that existing mental health resources were not relevant to the cultural and unique experiences that our black students faced. To provide a holistic approach to our student support, we needed to develop culturally relevant resources co-created by their peers.</p><p>Using virtual and in-person focus groups and workshops, the project team worked with students to develop all materials. The project aimed to remove the financial barriers to participation by paying student collaborators. This resulted in a student-led approach at every stage of the project, with input from a wide range of intersectional groups of black students at LSBU, including a mix of gender, sexuality, age ranges, cultural backgrounds and courses. Over 600 students contributed to our data collection to provide insight and the learning this provided allowed us to work with over 250 students to co-create resources.</p><h3>Support for black students across London</h3><p>We’re proud to have developed a range of podcasts, blogs and videos which address how difficult it is for black students to talk about mental health and gain access to the right support. The resources acknowledge the impact of racial microaggressions and internalised racism and provide proactive mental health practices to help minimise the potentially negative impact of students' experiences.</p><p>We partnered with Good Thinking because it works innovatively with London communities to co-create digital mental wellbeing tools and advice to support children, young people and adults. This has been the same approach we have taken to ensure student voice in our content.</p><p>At LSBU, we are passionate about widening participation and using our research and insights to benefit society more broadly. Through our partnership with Good Thinking, we aim for the support, resources and advice to reach a wider range of students and service users across London’s black communities.</p><h3>Find the resources on Good Thinking</h3><p>You’ll find the resources created by the Black Students Mental Health Project on Good Thinking’s new <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/students/LSBU-Black-students-mental-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Student Mental Health Hub</a>.

This is because racism is an organising structure of individual perceptions and personal experiences, which means that marginalised community members are constantly encountering racism on systemic, institutional and interpersonal levels. This can mean that, when racism is not named and properly processed, it may lead to the racist beliefs about marginalised communities, including the community a person belongs to, becoming internalised.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is internalised racism?</h3><p>When racism is internalised, the person accepts the negative attitudes, beliefs, stereotypes and ideologies that the dominant society perpetuates about the marginalised racial group. The power that the dominant group holds in society enables them to determine what is correct, acceptable or normal. Any deviation from this standard is therefore labelled as incorrect, unacceptable and/or abnormal.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, internalised racist beliefs can become psychologically toxic and may evoke negative emotions which can lead to the onset of mental health conditions, such as depression. Internalised oppression is linked to feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, self-doubt, helplessness and hopelessness. It is also implicated in the self-perpetuation of oppression and an anti-black bias.&nbsp;</p><p>Internalised oppression can emerge over time and may elicit denial and a sense of powerlessness. Some research suggests that internalised racism occurs through the shame and the humiliation that occurs when the self is repeatedly devalued. It should be noted that depression linked to racism could be suppressed rage. It might also be expressed through obesity, addictions, high blood pressure, stress or domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><h3>Understanding stereotypes</h3><p>Understanding stereotypes and the role they play in hampering thinking capacity is important when exploring racism. Stereotypes are thinking shortcuts that we all use to sort or organise objects in our social environment. These can be particularly helpful in pressurised environments as they reduce the amount of brain power we need to process the things we encounter and help us to respond with speed.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with stereotypes is that they are generalisations and therefore do not take into consideration all of the available information. As such, they can often be linked to negative outcomes for the individuals or groups associated with them. There has been a considerable amount of research indicating that being conscious of a negative stereotype which relates to a specific aspect of your identity can lead to poor or underperformance.</p><p>As such, it is important to explore whether you have internalised negative stereotypes which result in internalised oppression and racism. You can begin to do this by asking yourself about how you have been racially socialised.&nbsp;</p>","columnWidth":"full"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsInfoTabs","id":"91","tabs":[{"id":"505","title":"Racial socialisation","content":"<p>Racial socialisation is a process frequently initiated by black parents during their children’s childhood and adolescence. When parents are effective in racially socialising their children, they create a protective buffer against the negative racial messaging and experiences their children will encounter whilst living in marginalised environments. It is important to note that racial socialisation occurs whether parents approach it actively or not.&nbsp;</p><p>People who have internalised racism are likely to have had little or no active or positive racial socialisation and may have passively internalised negative messaging about their racial group. Others who have experienced proactive racial socialisation have consistently been associated with the development of racial pride and experience the psychological benefits of racial socialisation, such as resilience.</p><p>Use the illustration below to explore the ways you have been socialised and begin to question some of the assumptions you may make about your racial group.</p><p><a href=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Harro_1997_Cycle_of_Socialization_dbb1bf9fc9.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to view a larger image of the illustration below</em></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\"><img src=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Harro_1997_Cycle_of_Socialization_83f384e723.png\" alt=\"Illustration of Harro\"></span></p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">Harro's (1997) Cycle of Socialization</em></p><p><br></p><p>Think about a thought you have about your racial group that may have been implanted through your marginalised experience.

Why or why not?</li><li>Is it black and white or more complicated?</li><li>Is the thought an exaggeration of the facts?</li><li>Is the thought based on my or someone else's feelings or beliefs?</li></ul><p>Being treated as racially inferior can feel painful so it is important to remember that this treatment is based upon the false belief of white superiority. Whilst this could be destructive to the way you define yourself, your family, your community and your culture, you can choose your strategies (e.g. exploring racial identity and promoting racial pride) and reject that inferiority.</p>"},{"id":"506","title":"Racial identity development","content":"<p>There are a number of models which explore the development of racial identity. For example, William Cross developed the model of Nigrescence, which describes a process of becoming black.&nbsp;Cross believed that black people move through five developmental stages in the process of resocialisation.

But the impact of these racialised encounters can increase a black student’s vulnerability to mental health difficulties and can contribute to depression, anxiety, anger, withdrawal, physical illness, substance misuse and even psychosis.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"495","title":"Stigma and looking out for your mental health as a black student","content":"<p>The opportunity to express your experience of the world is crucial to positive mental functioning but seeking mental health support is difficult for many black people. Without an opportunity to express your experience, pressure builds which can cause anxiety, isolation and a feeling of suffering in silence.&nbsp;</p><p>The history of slavery and colonialism and the internalised historical narrative of black people being strong supports the notion that mental health difficulties are a form of weakness. Today, the dynamics of race and the remnants of those traumatic histories continue. Black people are often treated as not having emotions and vulnerabilities in interactions with police or mental health services. Therefore their interactions with both the police and mental health services may be problematic and can lead to mistrust in these services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of routes to treatment for mental and emotional problems, black people are almost five times as likely as white people to be detained under the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/mental-health/detentions-under-the-mental-health-act/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health Act</a>. The stigma around mental health in black communities and mistrust of support services offered by white institutions are key factors in mental health problems not being recognised or supported early enough. But racial discrimination also has an impact – as the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/763547/Modernising_the_Mental_Health_Act___increasing_choice__reducing_compulsion___summary_version.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Independent Review of the Mental Health Act </a>notes, \"structural factors which engender racism, stigma and stereotyping increase the risk of differential experiences [of mental health care] in ethnic minority communities\".&nbsp;</p><p>The need for a range of culturally appropriate avenues and treatments for mental ill health plays a role in countering black people’s resistance to finding support. In the black community, faith-based practices offer some black students support and strength during their studies. Seeing difficult experiences through this lens can help immensely and be a great source of comfort, resilience and self-worth. However, it should also be noted that these are not available to people who do not share the same faith and can be difficult to access. Also, in some instances, faith-based institutions can become a place of anxiety for some people and can create conditions that make a person feel less secure sharing their concerns about their mental health.</p><p>Mental health is often framed negatively in a way that involves professionals or medication when things get to a crisis stage. But we all have mental health and everyone’s mental health is on a scale between positive and negative mental functioning. It is important to recognise that prevention is better than cure and there are many things that you, as a black student, can do to protect and manage your mental health.</p>"}]},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"475","content":"<h2>What will I get out of this blog?</h2><p>This guidance is not ‘one size fits all’.

These representations derive from falsehoods created to justify slavery and colonialism by diverting attention away from the aggression that black people encountered daily. Today, stereotyped representations of being strong, sexual and savage – the angry black woman or the aggressive black male – maintain the belief that black people are to be feared.&nbsp;</p><p>Damaging racial stereotypes also present black people as having low intelligence. The dominance of these representations can then limit the potential of black people and cause a collective internalisation of stereotypes (e.g. hyper-masculinity which deters many black men from showing emotion and seeking support and results in them suffering in silence).&nbsp;</p><p>Internalised racist stereotypes can also affect how black people feel about pursuing academic learning or narrow their perspective of what it means to be black.

You may also feel unseen by other students and staff, black or otherwise. These encounters can result in a feeling of isolation, impact your self-esteem and cause you to withdraw.&nbsp;</p><p>If your disability is invisible, symptoms can often be misinterpreted and seen through the lens of racial stereotypes.

As a result, encounters with racial prejudice on your course can make you doubt your intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>Microaggressions and discrimination within the university and outside it (e.g. from private landlords) can also affect your sense of safety and security. These encounters can isolate you and increase feelings of vulnerability leading you to miss the familiarity of your home country and might even cause you to leave your course.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside this, your cultural upbringing can be very different and you may even feel alienated from black British students. A lack of social circles, which can be further affected by your eligibility to work, can lead to additional feelings of loneliness and social isolation. In addition, as a black international student, it might be more difficult or uncomfortable for you to talk about your mental health because you come from a culture where it is seen as private or taboo and your family has expectations of you to perform well.</p><h3>Positive mental health practices</h3><ul><li>Speak your language when you get the opportunity (if English is not your first language) as this can help to alleviate feelings of isolation and reinforce your identity.</li><li>Use free communication apps to keep in touch with your friends and family at home.

The chemicals released by adrenal glands effectively set us up for either of those options but are more of a hindrance now – particularly when those responses can be triggered many times in a day.</p><p>Fortunately, there are ways we can take back control of our bodies with techniques to help us calm down and relax. While no handy ‘one size fits all’ formula exists yet (as far as I know), there are different paths to the same goal and, hopefully, some of the ideas below may work for you. These can sometimes work together with a cumulative benefit and can lead to other changes – go to bed relaxed, and you will probably get a better night’s sleep, and so be better able to cope with the next day.</p><p><strong>Decompress</strong></p><p>Have a personal space and time available for you each day to act as a buffer, a chance to unwind. Great if you have some form of Man Cave or She Shed – if not, look for somewhere that you can reserve for you. If relevant, having a break between coming back from work and resuming home life can be very helpful.</p><p><strong>Activities</strong></p><p>Anything that slows our breathing down helps send an ‘all-clear’ to our body that the threat has passed. Activities such as painting, writing (keep a journal?), jigsaws, Sudoku, crosswords, model making can all help with this, as can listening to relaxing music. Meditation and mindfulness can help. If you have a smartphone, there are free metronome apps you can experiment with to practice slowing your breathing.</p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Walking is a great way to combine fitness with relaxation. Tai Chi, Qigong and Yoga can all help as well. While the latter is probably best done with an experienced teacher, there are YouTube videos available for the others.</p><p><strong>Talk</strong></p><p>Worries can go round inside our heads, just digging a deeper groove and intensifying over time. Get them out into the open, and fears can shrink or even dissolve. You may gain a new insight or understanding about your challenge. Pretty much everyone benefits from the occasional ‘damn good listening to’. Look for someone you can talk to openly, who will concentrate on your needs.</p><p>As the psychologist Carl Rogers said, <em>‘We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy.

I have learnt that, if you have anxiety, this is NOT the football team you want to support.</p><p>Anxiety can come for me in many different forms. Whether it is a full-blown panic attack or a tiny worry in the back of my head, it’s always there. Even writing this, I’m feeling it!</p><p>There are lots of ways to deal with anxiety. People suggest slow breathing, facing your fears and walking straight into it or, in my case, completely running away from it and not being able to go to school for four years! Something which I do not advise.</p><p><strong>Missing school</strong></p><p>I was 11 years old and moving to a completely new school. For most people, this would be a major cause of anxiety but I was surprisingly positive (for once). I had all my closest friends moving with me, I was excited to meet new people and I was ready to get out of the absolute nightmare I thought primary school was! Little did I know it was about to get a whole lot worse.</p><p>I was a goofy, loud, sarcastic and abnormally tall 11-year-old – all traits I still have now – however I added one more quality, dad jokes. Yes, I know, I hate them too. My dad, however, is extremely proud that he has ruined my humour forever!</p><p>So, I had just started secondary school and everything was going well, or so I thought (cue dramatic sound effect), when around five months into year 7, I woke up one morning and everything fell apart. I could not get into the car, I could not breathe, I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.</p><p>Everything anyone had ever told me about how to handle myself in these situations had gone flying out the window and even the thought of seeing anyone outside of my house made me burst into tears and feel overwhelmed with panic. I did not know how to control myself. I didn’t know what was happening. When was it going to end?</p><p>For the next two years, I didn’t attend school once. I tried many times. I got to the school and I couldn’t step inside. The same thing would happen again each time – that fear, that panic. It was as if there was a brick wall in front of me every time I tried. In the third year, I gradually went back to school for very short amounts of time, starting with 10 minutes a day sitting in a room alone and building up to one hour a day with one friend.</p><p>For three years of my school life, whether I was there or not, I did no work, I sat at home for the majority of the day, playing PlayStation, watching Netflix and football. Sounds great, right? Well, for some weird reason, it wasn’t. It was almost as if sitting at home all day doing nothing would fail to motivate me and stimulate my brain. Who would’ve thought?</p><p>One more thing that made it even worse was that, during years 7 and 8, everyone was having bar and bat mitzvahs. For those who don’t know, this is a Jewish celebration for 12 and 13-year-old boys and girls. It involves a ceremony and a huge party, which is the only bit most kids care about. So, whilst everyone was going out every weekend having the time of their lives partying, I was at home, on my own, watching them on social media. Even now, I still struggle to go to bar/bat mitzvahs and parties.</p><p><strong>Getting help</strong></p><p>Changing things around was a long slow process. I saw around eight different counsellors/psychologists, none of whom really helped me, and many of whom I am sure were exasperated by me. I couldn’t communicate and felt misunderstood, which usually made me feel quite angry, if anything. At that point, medication proved more helpful than counselling and I’m still on a low dose now.</p><p>There was no ‘turning point’ for me, it was gradual. There were many meltdowns and mostly they would be with my mum, who was my ‘go to’. She understood me and spoke to me on a level that did not make me feel judged and she knew me better than anyone. She never gave up and pushed me only to a point that she knew I could handle.</p><p>She had a plan for me. Initially it was just about getting dressed every single day into my school uniform, getting into the car, and driving to school. I didn’t need to step out of the car or go INTO school, I just needed to get there and back in my uniform. Sometimes even just getting into the car would take two hours. But we did it every single day.</p><p>Once I was able to easily to do that (after many months), I had to get into the school and step inside the building and then come straight out and home again. It was so hard. But I knew that I would not be pushed to do any more than mum had promised. I felt safe and never tricked into doing anything. It was all about trust. I just had to step into the building and step out again.</p><p>We pushed on and stuck to what we had planned to do that month. When that became easier, I had to stay in the building for five minutes. Months later, 10 minutes. Then eventually into a side room. Once I had mastered that, I felt confident enough to have a friend with me in the room (avoiding seeing anyone was a big issue for me). So mum would be in constant contact with the school telling them what the next stage was and, each time I mastered it, we would discuss between us what we thought I could manage for the next stage.</p><p>Beginning a new ‘step’ was always very difficult but we persevered – sometimes for months, day in day out, until it became comfortable. The first time I stepped into an actual classroom after a couple of years (for five minutes) was a massive achievement and, after a month of doing that every day, it was me that asked for an increase to 15 minutes.</p><p>So you can imagine how slow the progress was but eventually I was able to manage a whole lesson! Imagine that! And so lessons and timetables were planned weekly by mum and sent to the school and I had to try to stick to the plan that we had made together. Two lessons a day, eventually half a day etc.</p><p>Sometimes it would get too much and I’d feel awful and a failure but then mum would not make it an issue and start afresh with me the following day. And I always had support teachers with me. So we built it up over a long period of time, extending the goal. And, when that was reached, extending it again.</p><p><strong>Family and friends</strong></p><p>I consider myself very lucky. I had an extremely supportive family who wouldn’t scream or get annoyed at me whenever I panicked. I also had the best friends anyone could ask for, always looking out for me and supporting me even if they didn’t know why I wasn’t at school. Everyone cared.</p><p>With parties and social events (well, there weren’t very many as these were and still can be difficult), I really wanted to go and would beat myself up beforehand for many days! But mum would say “Go, stay for half an hour only and, if you want to stay longer, then text me.”</p><p>Mum would often get many texts from me. Some social events I would stay at, some I would come home from, and some I never made it to at all. But mum always convinced to me try – with an ‘out’ if I needed it. Somehow, throughout this whole process and the thousands of texts and meltdowns, she stuck with me and, most impressively of all, maintained her sanity and patience with me. Well, at least I think so!</p><p>I still remember one day, which really sums up how amazing my friends and family are. In year 7, when I first started missing school, the thought of telling everyone I had anxiety gave me even more anxiety, so I opted for the easy way out. I told my friends I was off because I had glandular fever. How my friends believed that I, a weird, awkward, taller-than-everyone-else 11-year-old, contracted what is predominantly known as “the kissing disease” is beyond me, but they did.</p><p>I mention this because, in year 9, when I was 13 years old, I was seeing my friends a lot and slightly happier than I previously had been, so I decided I was sick of hiding, sick of lying to people and just wanted to tell the truth. I wrote a long and detailed message explaining to my friends what was really “wrong with me”. This was a huge step forward for me. My friends were incredibly understanding, offered their full support to me and didn’t judge me at all. They didn’t take it too seriously and treated me the same as they always did and, of course, constantly made jokes about it (which I wanted and loved).</p><p><strong>More in control</strong></p><p>That brings us to now, five years on. I am at school full time – well, as much as Boris is allowing me! I have grown as a person and really understand how to control my anxiety and deal with it. Of course, it’s not been easy. I’ve had some very tough times and have had to fight through them with the help of my family, friends and professionals.</p><p>I was able to catch up on all my work, which I found extremely stressful and daunting. I can be in lessons, be with friends and have had amazing support from the entire school to help me find my way back into being a full-time student. Luckily for me, COVID hitting allowed me to escape the nightmare of GCSEs, which was something of a blessing.</p><p>Of course, my anxiety hasn’t completely gone. I still have several moments and panic attacks but I have managed to control it and deal with it when the time is right, which comes naturally with experience. When it comes to panic attacks, this is not something you want but, oh well, I have them now.</p><p>I know anxiety can be different for everyone and everyone can have it in different ways, it’s just that mine is more serious and should be considered worse than everyone else’s (that’s one of those dad jokes I mentioned earlier).</p><p>In all seriousness, if you are reading this and you’ve dealt with or you’re dealing with anxiety or another mental health concern, here is my advice for you: Although it is different for everyone and your experience may not be the same as or even like mine, it WILL get better.

Do people always know when they’re stressed? The answer was quite surprising. And when we look further into the issue of burn out, it gets really interesting.</p><p>Mental health problems don’t announce themselves with a fanfare. Often, they creep up on you, slowly changing how you see the world and affecting how well you feel and function. It’s no easier for those around you to spot them, and the most conscientious people can struggle on silently. So, when feeling ‘not right’ many people look online, through search and social media, and the first word they tend to turn to is ‘stress’. Type stress into Google search and you will get well over a billion pages – almost three to five times the number of pages for anxiety or depression. People also search for what they feel, and at Good Thinking we’ve found a common feeling was ‘racing thoughts’ in addition to ‘constant worrying’ and ‘feeling overwhelmed’. So many people don’t actually feel stressed, but notice something different in themselves, and want to understand what it means. But often there is just a focus on work, on how much there is to do, and feeling bad about never getting to a point of feeling on top of things. The most stressed among us can just feel bad about their struggle to work.</p><p>Mental health problems don’t announce themselves with a fanfare. Often, they creep up on you, slowly changing how you see the world and affecting how well you feel and function. It’s no easier for those around you to spot them, and the most conscientious people can struggle on silently.</p><p>Unchecked, stress can impact on your physical health and mental health, and in time lead to burn out. This is not a new mental health problem, but it is remarkable that burn out is occurring in surprising situations; professional video gamers and You Tubers seem to be struggling as much as public sector workers. So why would those working in the digital economy be at risk in the same way that our team members might?</p><p>The term ‘burn out’ was coined by the psychologist Herbert Freudenberger in1974; he described it as particularly relevant to caring professionals. Yet three years before in 1971, in the US, it was air traffic controllers who were commonly reporting vocational ‘burn out,’ a form of exhaustion that is noticed by a decline in quantity and quality of work. This was very similar to what doctors were later reporting, yet in a very different area of work. But why?</p><p>During the 1960s and 1970s, air traffic controllers reported poor training experiences, inadequate equipment, rapidly changing shift patterns, long shifts without breaks, fatigue, monotony due to automation, and challenges arising from human-machine interfaces. Sound familiar? A huge increase in air traffic, with a small rise in the number of controllers, pushed working conditions beyond what controllers considered to be safe. After human errors were linked to fatal mid-air collisions, things started to change.</p><p>Research showed though that those who ‘burnt out’ started off in a better state than their colleagues who didn’t get so stressed, and on the whole were more conscientious and competent. It seemed that workers who strive hardest to meet professional ideals may increase their risk of burnout, which then contributes to them falling to reach those ideals. Having the best ideals or goals could get in the way, causing unintentional harm to themselves or to those they are intending to help. It is sad that back then there was now way to track how you are feeling, and take steps to care for yourself better, when stress was building, and burn out a few steps away.</p><p>Those who ‘burnt out’ started off in a better state than their colleagues who didn’t get so stressed, and on the whole were more conscientious and competent. It seemed that workers who strive hardest to meet professional ideals may increase their risk of burnout.</p><p>In a world now where we are surrounded by machines and intelligent devices, we can often experience a subtle pressure to be the same, and never properly switch off. Some people will never let their phone battery go flat, and they treat themselves the same. And the most regrettable aspect is that they then (because of our biology and psychology, our need to sleep, rest and take breaks, eat and feel the sunshine) just can’t offer the level of commitment to their work as they would like to. Yet if they could look after themselves better, everyone would benefit.</p><p>This is no judgement on anyone. I applaud you if you are one of those fine hardworking individuals who wants to make a difference and go the extra distance. This is just a plea that you use services like Good Thinking to track yourself and use the advice and tools to look after yourself better – before you begin feeling burnt out. Our self-assessment can be a safe place to start, or you might just want to read about stress some more to help explore how you are feeling.</p><p>So, don’t settle for second best; put yourself first, and your best will follow.

But on Time to Talk Day, talking takes on a special meaning. On this day we are all challenged to be more open about mental health issues and find ways of being able to talk about them.</p><p>When we can’t talk about something, it grows in size, yet is buried in secrecy. And that isn’t just a burden that you carry yourself; if too much is kept private or secret in our communities and workplaces, when someone is struggling they feel more alone and bad, feeling everyone else is okay, even though research tells us again and again they all aren’t okay.</p><p>So being open about how you might struggle with stress, anxiety or depression not only may lighten your load, but also help others. But talking can’t be to order, something you have to do; it might become something that you understand better and learn to do.</p><p>At Good Thinking we realise that everyone is at a different stage in a journey, from feeling bad and not sure why, to doing the things that make those feelings better, or at least smaller. Our research told us that when someone is trying to make sense of what they are feeling, they are not ready to talk, but they are ready to listen. And they don’t just want to hear talk of diagnoses, medication or therapy; what helps is listening to or reading about how a mental health problem feels. They may want to understand that better, and so we provide a range of content, and a really comprehensive self-assessment. These might make more sense of those uncomfortable feelings, and perhaps help you see how you can change how you feel. Perhaps, towards the end of that journey, it is time to talk.</p><p>But you don’t have to talk about mental health to feel happier.

It is curious that only at this point in human history are we starting to take seriously that poor sleep is a mental and physical health problem, capable of causing terrible distress and lasting poor health consequences. At Good Thinking, we’ve started to understand better this silent, hidden epidemic and are trying to do something about it. We listened to some of those with poor sleep and what we found out was really interesting, but first let’s have a look at the issue.</p><h3>What’s the problem with not sleeping?</h3><p>“Many surveys show that up to 33% of the adult population have regular difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep. After depression, sleep problems are the third most common psychological reasons for appointments in general practice. Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or worsening of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes. Poor sleep doesn’t just make you feel bad, it actually impacts on your physical health and future.</p><p><em>33% of the adult population have regular difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep</em></p><p>Insomnia becomes a chronic problem when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is also distressed by their sleep symptoms. But how many people can talk about this distress and their sleep problem; not many we found out. It is easier to talk about anxiety and depression than it is poor sleep.</p><h3>What do Londoners say about difficulties sleeping?</h3><p>“Because at Good Thinking we wanted to learn from Londoners, we talked to them about their sleep and also listened to what they said online. For example, on Facebook, sleep problems were talked about by more people than anxiety or depression, but they didn’t say very much. We noticed that the poor sleepers had far fewer interactions with others about their problem; people could talk more easily about their anxiety problems, but not sleep.</p><p>We learnt that people would post comments online in the middle of the night when they were struggling to sleep. 53% of people talked of having occasional sleep problems, whereas 28% had persistent problems. Those with persistent problems talked of feeling stressed and lonely; the sleep problems didn’t just separate them from those who could sleep, but they talked less about them, even during the day. It was as if sleep problems were something we just couldn’t talk about. Yet tiredness was the most common mental health symptom discussed on Facebook. The frustration with yourself for not being able to sleep added to the loneliness, the suffering in silence, and may have been a barrier to asking for professional help; asking for professional help was much less likely than it was for anxiety or depression.</p><p><em>53% of people talked of having occasional sleep problems, whereas 28% had persistent problems. Those with persistent problems talked of feeling stressed and lonely</em></p><h3>What’s the biggest cause of a sleepless night?</h3><p>“Whilst being unemployed or not being in a relationship was linked to sleep problems, so was being a mother, and struggling with family pressures. Being part of a family was no escape from the loneliness.</p><p>What was so painful about our discoveries was that many people just didn’t know what they could do, or that could make a difference. Many young adults started to have occasional problems before they 35 years old, and if not helped the occasional sleep problems became persistent, chronic.</p><h3>What can you do if a good night’s sleep seems an unlikely dream?</h3><p>“At Good Thinking, we ensured that our service offered many opportunities for people to learn more about sleep problems, and no longer feel alone with theirs. We have different tools that allow someone to assess their sleep and even thoroughly check out whether there could be a physical cause for their problems. We also provide free to Londoners apps and online courses, such as Sleepio and Be Mindful, and if you follow their guidance, it really makes a difference.</p><p>Because people feel frustrated with themselves, self-help techniques often feel like the best way forward. And guess what? Good Thinking is a 24/7 online service and there when you need it, not by appointment. Why not check out what’s there, whether for you or someone important to you? We really have to break down the shame that haunts those who can’t sleep well and reduce their night-time loneliness, and with confidence say those words:</p><p>“I hope you sleep well”</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Join the conversation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoodThinkingUK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 87, 53);\">@goodthinkingUK</a>&nbsp;on Twitter</li><li>Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://good-thinking.vercel.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 87, 53);\">Good Thinking</a>&nbsp;to explore tools and resources that can help you on your personal journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://good-thinking.vercel.app/about-good-thinking\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 87, 53);\">Learn more</a>&nbsp;about Good Thinking</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>About the author</strong></p><p>Dr Richard Graham is a Consultant Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist, former Clinical Director of the Adolescent Directorate at the Tavistock Clinic and Clinical Lead for Good Thinking.

Carers for those in later life, those with disabilities, those with long term health conditions or cancer, and those with mental health problems. This is an unpaid army of unsung heroes, often selflessly losing sight of their own health and dreams, as they commit themselves to the care of others.</p><p>According to research from the Carers Trust, there are 7 million carers in the UK, saving the economy £132 billion per year; a fact so powerful, it really should be on the side of a bus. 3 out of 5 of us will be carers at some point in our lives, and for many that will be in mid-life, though there are estimated to be at least 376,000 young adult carers in the UK aged 16–25. 47% of carers may be supporting someone for over 90 hours a week, and yet 38% of carers are in full or part-time work as well.</p><p>But despite the NHS depending upon carers for long term conditions, end of life care and for those with disabilities, many carers feel undervalued. According to the Carers UK’s “State of Caring Report 2018” a priority for carers was for the NHS “Recognise our contribution and value us.” It is of little surprise that the same report states that 71% of carers in the UK said they had suffered mental ill health as a result of caring. Further, 61% of carers in the UK said they had suffered physical ill health as a result of caring. The burden is great, the costs to the carer concerning, whilst the benefits to the economy and wider society significant. This is an area of marked inequality, which we at Good Thinking want to help with. But before sharing how we can and are starting to help, there is an aspect to caring that you may not have thought about.</p><p>It is widely known that doctors should not medically treat their families or anyone else that they have a close relationship with. This makes a lot of sense, and there have been tragedies when this guidance is overlooked. The American Medical Association states the reasons for this include “the doctor’s possible lack of professional objectivity, potential failure to probe sensitive topics or perform an intimate examination, and possible feeling of obligation to perform care for which he or she is unqualified.” Take a moment. Many of the reasons why doctors are not supposed to treat their families, we expect of carers to live with, and those they care for. Of course, this is usually because love, trust and forgiveness on both sides allows for the most difficult moments to borne with sensitivity; but this is a very complex process that should not be taken for granted.</p><p>There is hope that technology may help us more with some of the challenges, if not yet – advice on what do to, for example – and sometimes the opportunities ahead might surprise. At an event on using robots for care, a commonly held view was that being cared for by people was better. For older people that was only partly true; a robot helping you in the bathroom, maintained your dignity better.</p><p>Technology is already helping in many ways, even today. And for those isolated in their care of someone, being able to access support, and connect with other carers can lessen the loneliness. This is something we are hoping to develop further at Good Thinking, and are talking with Scope, the Alzheimer’s Society, Macmillan and even Money Savings Expert (the financial strain of being a carer is huge) to give our users a broad range of places where they can find support from people they relate to and identify with: ‘people like me’.</p><p>We also have a self-assessment tool that can help you check how your mental health is, and soon, we hope at the end of that assessment you can get advice from and opportunities in your local community that could help. There is even a section for carers in the self-assessment.</p><p>We also know that carers need to prioritise their own self-care. We have tips to help with that, from trying to manage the anxieties and worries about your situation, to improving your mood through mindfulness, or just simple tips that may help improve sleep. But we need to do more, and we will be working hard to do so.</p><p>At a time of rapid global change and shifting values, it is important that we take time in Carers Week to learn something from those who are in many ways supporting us all, through their compassion and sacrifices. And if we can make time to do that, we may then want to create a world where we give something back to them.</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Join the conversation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoodThinkingUK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@goodthinkingUK</a> on Twitter</li><li>Visit <a href=\"/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Good Thinking</a> to explore tools and resources that can help you on your personal journey.</li><li><a href=\"/about-good-thinking/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a> about Good Thinking</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>About the author</strong></p><p>Dr Richard Graham is a Consultant Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist, former Clinical Director of the Adolescent Directorate at the Tavistock Clinic and Clinical Lead for Good Thinking.

I had to, what would people think if I went sick now?</em></p><p><em>Keep on, just get through this set of shifts, then it’s one more week closer to retirement.</em></p><p>That’s how my thought processes went in the winter of 2018. Looking back, I realise now how much pressure I was putting myself under. I don’t know if it is a male thing or a police thing or a combination of the two but I’d spent almost 30 years in policing and had fixed in my mind how the last few days of my service would play out – last day on patrol, handing back the uniform, cakes, handshakes and good wishes from my colleagues.</p><p>As I worked through the winter months of 2018 the reality was that my mental health was failing. 30 years of exposure to trauma was taking its toll. Austerity had played its part. As a specialist family liaison officer supporting families of road death, fewer officers meant I was exposed to far more grief and trauma. Several of the cases I dealt with in those final years were children and young people, often multiple child fatalities. They were always the toughest ones.</p><p>I was used to the challenges of shift work. I’d worked in uniform on various rolling shift patterns throughout my service. 6-7 hours of sleep would see me through. When the disturbed sleep came it wiped me out. I’d be able to fall asleep with few difficulties but 3 or 4 hours later I’d be awake. Thinking, mulling things over, questioning the things that I’d known and accepted to be true. Then came the intrusive images – particularly the children. The photos I’d requested from the bereaved families for release to the press, now came to mind – daily. The haunting image of a 2-year-old boy was the most frequent, killed on a road two miles from my home, a road that I travelled on frequently. I didn’t need the physical reminder, the image always seemed to be with me anyway.</p><p>One day when travelling to work I began to have what I now know were palpitations. My heart was racing, my throat was tight, I gripped the steering wheel, I began to sweat. More than that, and more worryingly for me, was the sense of dread of approaching my place of work. From that time on, it seemed like a cascade effect was in unstoppable flow. One racing thought triggered another – a domino fell. I’d have feelings of anger and rage – a domino fell. I had a deep sense of guilt for perceived organisational failings that I had no control over – another domino fell.</p><p>Then came the mind fog. The inability to do simple routine tasks. It was like someone had pressed the pause button on my thoughts and actions. How could I get something so wrong, something that I’ve done hundreds of times before?</p><p>I’d taught fellow colleagues on stress management and building resilience.</p><p>How could this be happening to me?</p><p>I’m a Christian. I have my faith to support me. I lead a team of chaplains.</p><p>How could this be happening to me?</p><p>I had no real worries. Everything was fine at home. No finance issues, job lined up for post-retirement.</p><p>How could this be happening to me?</p><p>Suicidal thoughts.</p><p>How could this be happening to me?</p><p>So I threw myself in to the coping strategies that had worked before.</p><p>Hitting the gym, taking up boxing, running.</p><p>No change.</p><p>My faith was strong. Prayer, worship, fellowship and friendship.</p><p>No change.</p><p>Music. Classical – relaxing and uplifting.</p><p>No change.</p><p>Fresh air. Long walks.</p><p>No change.</p><p>Just keep going – the finish line is in sight. 10th July 2019, retirement day. Then all this will stop. The reality was the more that I thought about retirement the more anxious I became.</p><p>Eventually, I surrendered some of my pride and acknowledged that I needed help. Work assisted by varying my shifts so I didn’t work beyond 11pm – that helped with some of the sleep aspects. The Police Federation organised counselling and that really helped me deal with some of the trauma that I had been carrying for years.</p><p>The doctor prescribed meds for the palpitations.</p><p>Even then my stubbornness hindered my recovery. I wouldn’t go sick (that finish line was my sole objective), so counselling took place in duty time. How dumb was that. Getting my head sorted out and then within the hour responding to the same calls that exposed me to more trauma. I declined anti-depressants, fearful that they would make me ‘someone I wasn’t’. Who was I trying to kid? That had already happened.</p><p>Eventually I came to a place of realisation that if I was going to make it to retirement and have any quality of life in my post-police life, I had to surrender all my pride and get myself sorted out. The doctor signed me off work, actually with a big sigh of relief from him that I had come to that decision. Appropriate medication was prescribed and I secured two weeks of intensive Psychological Wellbeing therapy at a Police Treatment Centre.</p><p>So what did I learn from journey through depression and post-traumatic stress?</p><p>No one is immune. It doesn’t really matter how much you know about the condition or your life and professional experience. Faith can help but it isn’t always the only answer.</p><p>I now talk about my ‘five smooth stones’. Remember the Bible story of David and Goliath? He had to face the giant and to do so he had to choose ‘five smooth stones’ to place in his sling – the only way to defeat his enemy.</p><p>My ‘five smooth stones’:</p><ul><li>Medication</li><li>Mindfulness – breathing and relaxation techniques</li><li>Therapy – appropriate counselling</li><li>Faith – prayer, worship, meditation</li><li>Fellowship – friendship with honesty, trust and accountability</li></ul><p>We can all face ‘giants’ at some point in our lives. Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress injuries are just some of them.</p><p>What’s your battle plan to help you slay your ‘giant’?</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>A message from us</strong></h3><p>Good Thinking recommends various NHS-approved wellbeing apps, such as <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/resources/be-mindful/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Be Mindful</a>, which is free if you live or work in London.

My peers would describe me as, a ‘hard-working and driven individual’ but the challenges I faced with my mental health made things difficult at key moments in my life. From about the age of 15; I used to be impulsive and confrontational. Often getting into fights with my peers, teachers and strangers.</p><p>I remember becoming extremely stressed during my GCSEs. I am the youngest out of five brothers, so I’ve always felt like I drew the short straw. I made myself feel that everything was down to me. Therefore, I was always concerned I would not achieve the standards I had put upon myself. I became so stressed that I had suffered seizures.</p><p>I was also paranoid. I would walk past a group of people and I would convince myself that the group were watching me, talking about me or laughing at me. The worst part was the experience of my voices. I became more and more paranoid, stressed and I put unhealthy pressure on myself. My voices started to take control over my life and I no longer felt I had control of my own actions and thoughts.</p><p>I couldn’t find any happiness, anywhere. I was using cannabis to self-medicate, thinking it could help me. I kept being told to challenge my voices, but my option became to take the easy way out. I told myself “If I end my life, I won’t have to deal with this any longer”.</p><p>At that point, it was inevitable I was seen by a Doctor. I was referred to a child adolescent mental health service and my therapist saved my life. It was not clear to me in the moment. Until, I learnt with any hardship follows ease.</p><p>The day, I attempted to take my life, I remember my brother in the room crying to me “if you want to hurt yourself, you’re going to have to hurt me first”.</p><p>On that day, the police were forced to take me into custody for affray. Although it was very clear I was mentally unwell, they treated it as a crime before anything else.</p><p>It was also then; I would be admitted into a mental health. Arriving at the mental health hospital, I was always aware of what was happening. However, I was not aware what it would be like nor how long I would end up being there.</p><p>I spent approximately two years in and out of hospital. I met individuals who I will never forget; they encouraged me to be stronger. The experience shaped my future, my ambition, and my goal in life.</p><p>Today I am much stronger and wiser individual. While it was difficult adjusting to these changes, I found the drive I had lost throughout the worst part of my mental health. I became so willing to help the people in a similar situation who believe, there is no hope or inspiration.</p><p>I pride myself in being a mental health and digital health ambassador. Along with being, a lived experienced individual.</p><p>Now I look back at those difficult times and I am glad I was put through those challenges. lot of my recovery came from the willingness to want to get better. I was tired of restricting myself and not do anything about the difficulty I was facing.</p><p>Everyone has their tribulations. I just had to be patient.</p><p>Of course, I lost many friends during the peak of my mental health. That only comes as part of the journey, and I quickly learnt there is no reward in complaining. I kept hopeful, reminding myself “It could be worse”.</p><p>All our struggles are determined by our perspective. I am happy and proud; I am a superhero with a duty because “that person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero”</p><p>So, I do what I can, the best that I can.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>A message from us</strong></h3><p>We’d like to thank Antonio for sharing his experience of anxiety with the Good Thinking community.</p><p>Good Thinking provides a range of resources to support your mental health, including free NHS-approved wellbeing apps, expert advice and podcasts.

As research by Mind[1] shows, this has been intensified for people with a pre-existing mental health issue. Some of the challenges of living through a global pandemic, including local and national lockdowns, low or reduced incomes, job insecurity and problem debt, alongside poor mental health, have created a toxic combination.</p><p>Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems experienced. According to a recent ONS report[2], people with concerns about finances reported much higher levels of anxiety. And, with financial problems and problem debt increasing during the pandemic, the scale of the problem is evident.</p><p>The stress of debt coupled with anxiety can be so destructive. It affects family relationships, both physical and mental health, and can be very isolating. It can feel like you have nowhere to turn, but there is a solution – right on your doorstep.</p><p><strong>What are the causes of debt?</strong></p><p>Debt can be caused by many different factors, such as ill health, bereavement, relationship breakdown or low income. The pandemic has also pushed many Londoners into debt through a reduction in working hours or income, which has escalated situations where people are already struggling.</p><p>Often, debt can be a symptom of poor mental health so, as Christians Against Poverty (CAP) workers, we make sure that we focus on building positive relationships to help people make and achieve their goals. Through this holistic support, we see many of our clients have their mental health transformed as they begin to feel more positive and access further help and support that they need. All of CAP’s support is completely free of charge and, importantly, completely free of judgement.</p><p><strong>What do our clients have to say?</strong></p><p>Steven said, “It was tough over the time, dealing with my debts. My mental health was up and down but with Dave’s (CAP debt coach) support now I’m debt free! I started working more on my life and getting my mental health better. Now I don’t get any more suicidal thoughts and I’ve started getting my life back. So with the help from Dave and CAP, I’m now debt free and having a better life.”</p><p>Another client, Christina, was in a bad place financially and mentally but, with CAP’s help has now gone debt free and started helping other people as a volunteer. When she became debt free, she said, “The penny is now just dropping that I haven’t got that sickening worry of debt over me any more. I’d say to anyone thinking about contacting CAP, do it! They’ll help with moral support, 150%! You don’t need to suffer. Now I’m a befriender (CAP volunteer visiting others in debt). It’s been a very hard journey – but it’s been amazing as well. I wouldn’t want to see anyone else go through suffering from worrying about debt as they don’t have to.”</p><p>As the Regional Leader for Christians Against Poverty (CAP) in London, I’m privileged and humbled to be able to lead a team of 50 frontline workers meeting and supporting people across London. This incredible team, along with numerous volunteers like Christina and Steven, helps people with unmanageable debts, as well as teaching budgeting skills, the importance of developing good habits and running job clubs.</p><p><strong>Top tips for dealing with debt</strong></p><p>Over my time working for CAP and helping people across this city, I’ve seen that the most important things you can do are:</p><p>● Get help as early as possible – it makes a big difference. In less than six minutes, you can call our CAP Freephone number (0800 328 0006) and book an appointment with one of our friendly team. Alongside CAP, there are also lots of other organisations that offer free debt advice, such as <a href=\"https://www.stepchange.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">StepChange</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Money Advice Service</a>.</p><p>● Speak up. If you’re struggling and don’t know where to turn, speak to your local GP. Your doctor can suggest a range of strategies to help.</p><p>● Seek help from organisations like Good Thinking where you’ll find a range of guides and helpful resources, including podcasts with great tips from people who’ve been helped.</p><p>If you know things are out of control and you’re stressed, missing meals or sleep, please give CAP a call and let us help you get your life back on track.

Here, she looks at some of the concerns students have ahead of results day.</strong></p><p>If you’re a student receiving your results in August, you might be feeling pretty anxious right now.</p><p>You’re not alone.</p><p>You’ve been through the most disruptive 18 months in living experience in education, and now you’re receiving teacher-assessed grades (TAGs), which is different to how any other cohort has received their grades.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7044100\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">poll</a> we ran in June in our online community on <a href=\"https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Student Room</a>, almost 90% of students said they’re worried that receiving TAGs will negatively impact their future. A lot of students feel like it might hamper their ability to get the spot they want at college or uni, and some students are talking about being seen as ‘lesser’ because of not sitting exams.</p><p><strong><em>“I’m extremely worried about one grade that will impact my whole university place.”</em></strong></p><p>Right now, there might be a lot of people encouraging you to be proud of what you’ve achieved during the pandemic. We hope you do feel proud because you’ve done amazing at a really hard time. But we also want to let you know that if you’re not feeling super beamingly proud, that’s okay too.</p><p>Here, we’re going to explore a few reasons why that might be, and suggest some ways to process those feelings.</p><p><strong>I feel like an imposter</strong></p><p>Recently on The Student Room forums, we’ve been seeing how this worry about receiving grades in a different way can sometimes translate into feelings of ‘imposter syndrome’. This is when a person doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud’.</p><p>Most people will experience feelings of imposter syndrome at some point in their life, and it can be helpful to be equipped with some tools to manage that – to help build your resilience during what is a stressful time.</p><p>One helpful tip is to look at the bigger picture. Could you draw up a list of your strengths and accomplishments outside of the classroom? Or make a plan to do some things that really matter to you and that you enjoy? It’s also a good idea to talk to your friends and family about how you’re feeling – no doubt they’ve felt like an imposter at times too. This <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> contains some useful advice.</p><p><strong>What if my grades end up being higher than I expected?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of reasons why this might be great, but if you’re not entirely thrilled about it because of the way the results were given, that’s okay too. Sometimes imposter syndrome can creep in when it feels like you’ve been given a judgement or accolade that is of a higher standard than you expected. This might lead you to feeling worried that you might be ‘exposed’ or found out once you eventually start the next phase of your journey.</p><p>Why not get a sense check from your teachers or tutors, or even your friends and parents, about your doubts? They may have noticed you were working better and that the grades accurately reflect that hard work. You may have been comparing yourself to some idea of perfection, whereas in reality you were working hard and effectively.</p><p><strong>What if my grades end up being lower than I expected?</strong></p><p>This can be a really difficult time, especially if you feel you’ve not had a lot of control over your learning and assessments in the past two years as a result of the pandemic. If this is the case for you on results day, it’s important to bear in mind there are a lot of other options available to you.</p><p>If you’re keen on uni, you can explore some of those <a href=\"https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/university/apply/clearing/guide-to-clearing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or if you’re worried there may have been an error with your grades, here’s some information about <a href=\"https://www.theuniguide.co.uk/advice/cancelled-exams/how-to-appeal-your-teacher-assessed-grades\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">making an appeal</a>. Sometimes not being recognised for your actual ability can lead to feeling like you have to ‘prove’ yourself, which can place a lot of pressure on your mental health.</p><p>Disappointment is difficult, but you might find it useful to think about why you wanted those grades in the first place. When thinking about the future, consider the things you’re truly passionate about and interested in, regardless of what the grades say. Even if your next step ends up looking slightly different to what you’d originally planned, following what makes you inspired can really help with feeling fulfilled and motivated in the next phase of your journey.</p><p><strong>I feel like these results will determine my whole future</strong></p><p>Every year around results day, we see the emotional toll it can take when it feels like your results will determine your whole future. This year, you might also be dealing with feelings of unfairness or frustration because of the impact of the pandemic (which are completely beyond your control).</p><p>It’s easy for people in their careers already to say, ‘don’t worry, results don’t define you.’ But it’s understandable that, right now, it may actually feel like they do.</p><p>Here are some comments from students on The Student Room to help you cope with results day...</p><p><strong><em>“Even if you don't get the grades you expected, there will be so many opportunities for you and it doesn't mean doors have closed!”</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“Sometimes things don't work out and that isn't your fault - very few people actually get it right the first time round. Be open to opportunities, even if they aren't what you initially planned, and be ready to say 'yes' when they come your way.”</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“I got rejected on results day. Now I have 2 degrees, and am a fully funded PhD student!”</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“If things [don't] turn out the way you planned, then don't fret! There are still plenty of other doors and options out there for you to pursue.

We provide a safe space where they can confide in someone who understands the sensitivities surrounding their faith and culture and who will listen to them without judgement. We offer support for a range of issues, including anxiety, identity and relationships, and we do this for free over the phone, on live chat, on WhatsApp and by email.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the Muslim community in London and beyond – calls to our helpline relating to mental health rose by more than 300% last year. Young people, in particular, have faced many emotional challenges during lockdown. We’re here to encourage positive self-thinking and help them find the way forward, whether that’s dealing with the change in routine, coping with bereavement or managing other concerns.</p><p>20 years on from launching our helpline, we know that there are still many barriers preventing Muslims from accessing mental health support. These include stigma within the family or community and fear of receiving culturally insensitive care. It takes courage to reach out for help.</p><p>One of the most common reasons why people contact us is because they are experiencing religious guilt. This is often because of behavioural addictions or substance misuse. As many young Muslims don’t feel they can talk to their family, friends or faith leaders about this, it can lead to feelings of shame, isolation and loneliness and even to depression or other mental health disorders.</p><p>We always say that breaking the cycle of religious guilt starts with forgiving yourself and we recommend the following technique, which helps to boost both mental wellbeing and physical health.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>The 4 Rs of self-forgiveness</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Be merciful to others and you will receive mercy.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Forgive others and Allah will forgive you.</em></strong></p><ol><li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Accept what has happened and show yourself compassion.</li><li><strong>Remorse:</strong> Use guilt and remorse as a gateway to positive behaviour change.</li><li><strong>Restoration:</strong> Make amends with whomever you’re forgiving, even if it’s yourself.</li><li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Learn from the experience and grow as a person.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>To give you just one example of the support we provide... Bilal got in touch as he was feeling guilty about drinking alcohol as a way of coping with some difficult news and his ensuing depression. He had been trying to reconnect with his faith but felt he wasn’t worthy of God’s forgiveness. We spoke with Bilal about his feelings and discussed how he could break the cycle of religious guilt and depression. One of our suggestions was that he fill his time with activities and hobbies that he enjoys as this can have a hugely positive impact on wellbeing. We also connected Bilal with a counselling service to help with his depression.</p><p>As we said in our recent podcast for Good Thinking, it can take a lot to forgive yourself and allow yourself to get the support you need but it’s a vital step in moving forward. Like many of the people we talk to, Bilal told us that he found it liberating to confide in someone else for the first time. By listening carefully to his concerns and not imposing any religious or moral beliefs on him, we helped Bilal to explore his emotions and find solutions that work for him.</p><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic having gravely impacted the Muslim community, it’s more important than ever that we continue to provide confidential, non-judgemental and empowering support.

So, what has my Covid experience been like?</p><p>It’s A Sin sparked questions. I realised I have issues. Deeply buried. Not dealt with in four decades. Survivor guilt, vicarious trauma, bereavement. These experiences affected me as a young gay man. Fear of HIV. Grief after losing friends to AIDS. I needed to talk about how had I survived the AIDS pandemic. Picking up the phone, older gay friends got it and really understood what I was feeling.</p><p>There are many gay men my age who experienced stigma and discrimination. Many of us still dealing with it. I don’t want to forget those years as a young gay man working in HIV and Gay rights. National AIDS Trust was the first workplace I could be authentic and open about my sexuality.</p><p>It concerns me that the LGBTQI+ community has higher rates of suicidal distress, anxiety and depression. Around 1 in 3 of us are dealing with mental health problems compared to 1 in 4 in the general population. People who are LGBTQI+ are more likely to experience poor mental health and may also be impacted because of other compounded prejudice (e.g. BAME and disability).</p><p>The current Covid pandemic has potentially worsened the mental health of 20+ million people in the UK. I am among those as I reflect on my life and the challenges of Covid recovery. To get through lockdown, I followed four of the Five Ways to Wellbeing:</p><ol><li><strong>Connect with other people:</strong> I share cooking, making incredible new vegetarian recipes. I support, check in and listen when someone feels lockdown is getting to them. I’ve done podcasts and appeared online discussing LGBT and mental health.</li><li><strong>Learn new skills:</strong> I’ve done online courses. Gained accreditation in Mental Health First Aid. Submitted articles on LGBTQI+ and Mental Health. I’m starting Radio Drama and LGBTQ+ writing workshops. In September, I’m going to university to convert my drama diploma into a BA Hons.</li><li><strong>Give to others:</strong> I volunteer as a local Covid-19 Champion. Trustee with MenTalkHealth. I’m helping another charity design an anti-bullying social campaign. I support Queer Museum and am a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.</li><li><strong>Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness):</strong> Noticing seasons change. Spotting ‘new’ birds. Seeing snowdrops, daffodils, and my balcony spring into life.</li><li><strong>Be physically active:</strong> This is the one I need to do more of now the weather is improving!</li></ol><p>As a middle-aged gay man, my lived experience helps me embrace my identity. This has a positive impact on my wellbeing and confidence. I am free to express and accept myself with patience and to deal with whatever happens next. It will enable me to watch It’s a Sin again with acceptance, gratitude and pride.</p><p><strong>A message from us</strong></p><p>Good Thinking provides a range of resources to support your mental health, including NHS-approved wellbeing apps, expert advice, podcasts and videos.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic may remind you of other distressing times in your life.

Something that has been essential for me during the isolation of the past year has been remaining connected to other trans people who understand and respect my experiences. I've done this by participating in and volunteering for (online) groups with local and national LGBTQ+ organisations.</p><p>One of the worst parts of being trans is being part of a misunderstood minority that is so often discriminated against. Knowing that I have people I can relate to and talk about this with, whether online or in-person, has made a huge difference to my own mental health, especially during lockdown.</p><p>As we’ve learnt from recent events in the UK, even LGB people are not always supportive of trans rights, and sometimes even other trans people are not supportive of all trans/non-binary people, let alone wider society. Finding people that truly understand our experiences and support us is so essential to feeling connected to the world in a positive way.</p><p>This leads me on to the idea that mental health is not always an individual problem and is very much tied together (for me at least) with national and international events, especially regarding trans issues. I’m not going to write about going on walks or meditating or spending less time on social media; I know these things can help many people significantly, but I’m sure these suggestions will be more adequately covered by others. Also, I see these things as treating symptoms of mental ill health rather than treating the causes, which is still worthwhile, but perhaps more of a short-term-fix than some people might like them to be.</p><p>Living in a country that still denies so many rights to trans people has a massive impact on my own and, I’m sure, others’ mental health, especially when our safety and respect is so often devalued. Our lives and experiences are almost constantly being discussed in the public sphere, many times without trans people being present and too often with incredible amounts of negativity, which has a regular negative impact on my mental health. This isn’t helped by the strain the NHS has been under this last year due to COVID-19 and current backlash against trans healthcare, making it even harder for trans people to receive the support they need, whether for mental health or gender-related purposes.</p><p>Something that has definitely helped keep me afloat emotionally over the last year has been getting involved with organisations that are aware of these issues and are working towards plugging the gaps that COVID-19 has exacerbated. Not everyone may have the capacity to be active in tackling these wider issues but, if you can (and this can take many forms), I would highly recommend getting in touch with a local or national group. You will meet like-minded people, build community and help tackle some of the underlying causes of mental ill health for some of the worst affected people in our society, hopefully leading to better mental health and wellbeing for everyone in the long run, not just in the short term.</p><p>Being connected to people and knowing I’m contributing to important causes that are tackling wider issues, even in a small way, really helps me keep going during this time and I would 100% recommend it!</p><p><br></p><h3>A message from us</h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(30, 12, 6);\">We’d like to thank Jodi for sharing their experiences with the Good Thinking community.</span></p><p>Good Thinking provides a range of resources to support your mental health, including NHS-approved wellbeing apps, expert advice, podcasts and videos.
