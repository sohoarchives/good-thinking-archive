In December 2020, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began<strong>.</strong></p><p>One of the reasons you might feel anxious about coronavirus is because it is out of your control. If you follow the official advice, you can gain some control by helping to protect yourself and others.</p><p>As the Mental Health Foundation says, “Infectious disease outbreaks, like the current coronavirus, can be scary and affect our mental health.

Rumours, speculation and hoaxes about this particular virus may fuel anxiety and create disproportionate fear – for example, online images of long queues and empty shelves at supermarkets appeared to exacerbate panic buying in early 2020.</p><p>Google, Facebook, TikTok and other leading technology companies are taking action to reduce misinformation on their services – such as blocking ads that capitalise on coronavirus, adding ‘fact check’ labels and including links to WHO guidance – but you still need to think critically when you’re looking for information on the internet.</p><p>At this time, it might be helpful to limit your media intake to trusted sources and only check the news once or twice a day. When you see something about coronavirus on social media, don’t take it at face value – ask yourself, ‘is this person an expert?’ and then try to fact check the information. You might even decide to only view certain pages or posts or switch off notifications. If you have children who watch the news and use social media, give them the same advice and let them know they can discuss any concerns with you.</p><p>Read Good Thinking's <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/articles/disinformation-misinformation-fake-news\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">general advice about fake news</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.good-thinking.uk/youngpeople\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guidance for young people</a>.</p><p>Useful websites:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gov.uk</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NHS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/reality_check\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BBC Reality Check</a></li><li><a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/wuhan-coronavirus/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Fact</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a></li></ul>"},{"id":"315","title":"Stay connected","content":"<p>Try to keep everyone in your family informed about coronavirus. Children’s sense of security comes largely from their parents so explain calmly to them what is happening and let them know that you’re there for them. Have conversations with relatives who are at high risk so that you can be sure they have the latest information.</p><p>It’s important to stay connected – even if you can’t do it face-to-face. Fortunately, there are lots of ways to maintain contact, including phone, email, text, WhatsApp, FaceTime and Skype. You might like to set up an email or WhatsApp group for the whole family or arrange a daily time for a ‘check in’ chat. If you haven’t used these tools before, you should be able to find guidance online. If you don’t have a smartphone or computer, try to stay in touch with regular phone calls from your landline.</p><p>If you normally have regular appointments with a counsellor or therapist for an existing mental health condition, ask about having your sessions on the phone, by video or online.

Doing yoga, watching a film on Netflix or playing a board game with the kids are all good ways to switch off. You might even find it useful to download a meditation or mindfulness app – you’ll find various options here on Good Thinking.</p><p>Try to follow your normal routine as much as possible – get up at the same time, eat at the same time, talk to the same people (virtually, if you don’t live with them). And if you’re worried about the financial impact of coronavirus (e.g. if you have to take time off work or if you’re self-employed), find out what sick pay and other benefits you’re entitled to.</p><p>Don’t forget to look after your physical health too. Maintain a balanced diet, stay hydrated and try to get enough sleep. Shop for essentials as infrequently as possible, order food deliveries online or ask a friend or neighbour to shop for you and drop it off at your door.</p><p>If you have an underlying health condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, it’s especially important that you focus on your self-care routine and keep taking your medication. You might be able to book a remote consultation with your GP and order repeat prescriptions by phone or online and get it delivered by your pharmacy.</p><p>Physical activity has a very positive impact on your mental wellbeing.
