Meanwhile, community centres, pubs and other traditional hubs for social connection are waning and the rising cost of living has made socialising more difficult than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>And although we’re supposed to be more connected than ever through the internet and social media apps, sadly it often provides what I describe as a ‘fast food diet of connection’.&nbsp;</p><p>But the turning point for me personally came during lockdown when I felt increasingly isolated and in a far lonelier place than I’d ever been before. I was working from home, couldn’t see my friends and my long-term relationship had come to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the two years, my social circle had slowly but surely been devastated by the pandemic and communities that I had been part of had been forced to dissolve.</p><p>So coming out of the pandemic in 2021, I was left with the need to rebuild and yet, when I looked at the available options for connection, I was bemused that the only options seemed to be faith groups, sports clubs and, worst of all, dating apps.</p><p>There was nothing for young adults who simply wanted to connect, build new friendships, find community and rebuild their social circle, whilst exploring the very best of what London has to offer.</p><p>So, The Great London Friendship Project was very much born out of my own frustration, my own desire for connection and a passion to help other Londoners who were in the same situation as me to cultivate meaningful connections.</p>","columnWidth":"half"},{"__typename":"ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"618","content":"<p><img src=\"https://goodthinking-strapi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Picture1_fd0210431a.png\"

around 100-200 people, we had over 30,000 members and we were running three or four events a week, as we are today.</p><p>However, with a full-time job in marketing and running the project in all of my spare time, I was becoming massively overstretched by how it fast it had grown.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I had started reading a lot about loneliness and growing my awareness about the prevalence of the issue amongst young adults.</p><p>Whilst I had known it was a problem from the sheer numbers of young adults attending our events, the stories I’d heard and my own experience, I was

was for the age group overwhelmingly shown to be statistically in most dire need of support – young adults.</p><p>Impassioned (but with a fair amount of trepidation), I decided to leave my stable full-time job and gave myself six months to transform the community project into a grassroots movement with national aspirations.</p><p>Since then, we’ve had 100s of conversations with local authorities, charities and other organisations to try and challenge the misconceptions, educate people about the severity of the crisis that faces us and raise vital funding to keep the project alive.</p><p>Whilst it’s an ongoing battle and often feels like we’re fighting upstream, we’ve been heartened by a number of organisations that have come out in support of our mission over the last
